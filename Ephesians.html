                    <p>PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to
                        the faithful in Christ Jesus:</p>
                    <p>2 Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to you, and peace, from God our Father,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>3 Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
                        heavenly<span>&nbsp;</span><em>places</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Christ:</p>
                    <p>4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be
                        holy and without blame before him in love:</p>
                    <p>5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to
                        the good pleasure of his will,</p>
                    <p>6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</p>
                    <p>7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches
                        of his grace;</p>
                    <p>8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</p>
                    <p>9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath
                        purposed in himself:</p>
                    <p>10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in
                        Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on
                        earth;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in him:</p>
                    <p>11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of
                        him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</p>
                    <p>12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</p>
                    <p>13 In whom ye also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>trusted</em>, after that ye heard the word of truth, the
                        gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy
                        Spirit of promise,</p>
                    <p>14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto
                        the praise of his glory.</p>
                    <p>15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

                        wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</p>
                    <p>18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his
                        calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</p>
                    <p>19 And what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the exceeding greatness of his power
                        to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</p>
                    <p>20 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
                        set<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at his own right hand in the
                        heavenly<span>&nbsp;</span><em>places</em>,</p>
                    <p>21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named,
                        not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</p>
                    <p>22 And hath put all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under his feet, and gave
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the head over
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the church,</p>
                    <p>23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</p>

                    <p>2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince
                        of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:</p>
                    <p>3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling
                        the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as

                    <p>4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,</p>
                    <p>5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are

                    <p>6 And hath raised<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up together, and

                    <p>12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
                        strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</p>
                    <p>13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>14 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of

                    <p>16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity
                        thereby:</p>
                    <p>17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</p>
                    <p>18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</p>
                    <p>19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and
                        of the household of God;</p>

                    <p>2 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</p>
                    <p>3 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,</p>

                        supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of
                        the body unto the edifying of itself in love.</p>
                    <p>17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
                        walk, in the vanity of their mind,</p>
                    <p>18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance
                        that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</p>
                    <p>19 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness
                        with greediness.</p>
                    <p>20 But ye have not so learned Christ;</p>
                    <p>21 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:</p>
                    <p>22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to
                        the deceitful lusts;</p>
                    <p>23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</p>
                    <p>24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
                    </p>
                    <p>25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one
                        of another.</p>
                    <p>26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</p>
                    <p>27 Neither give place to the devil.</p>
                    <p>28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hands the thing which is good, that he may
                        have to give to him that needeth.</p>
                    <p>29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of
                        edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</p>
                    <p>30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>
                    <p>31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from
                        you, with all malice:</p>
                    <p>32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for
                        Christ&rsquo;s sake hath forgiven you.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>BE ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p>
                    <p>2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a
                        sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>
                    <p>3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as
                        becometh saints;</p>
                    <p>4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather
                        giving of thanks.</p>
                    <p>5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an
                        idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
                    <p>6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God
                        upon the children of disobedience.</p>
                    <p>7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p>
                    <p>8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but
                        now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span>light in the
                        Lord: walk as children of light:</p>
                    <p>9 (For the fruit of the Spirit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all goodness
                        and righteousness and truth;)</p>
                    <p>10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</p>
                    <p>11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
                        reprove<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</p>
                    <p>13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make
                        manifest is light.</p>
                    <p>14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give
                        thee light.</p>
                    <p>15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</p>
                    <p>16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>
                    <p>17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>.</p>
                    <p>18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</p>
                    <p>19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in
                        your heart to the Lord;</p>
                    <p>20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ;</p>
                    <p>21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</p>
                    <p>22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</p>
                    <p>23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is
                        the saviour of the body.</p>
                    <p>24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ,
                        so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        wives<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to their own husbands in every thing.</p>
                    <p>25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</p>
                    <p>26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</p>
                    <p>27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
                        such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>
                    <p>28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord
                        the church:</p>
                    <p>30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>
                    <p>31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and
                        they two shall be one flesh.</p>
                    <p>32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</p>
                    <p>33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the
                        wife<span>&nbsp;</span><em>see</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that she
                        reverence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>husband.</p>

                    <p>CHILDREN, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</p>
                    <p>2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</p>
                    <p>3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</p>
                    <p>4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and
                        admonition of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>5 Servants, be obedient to them that
                        are<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>masters according to the flesh, with fear
                        and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;</p>
                    <p>6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from
                        the heart;</p>
                    <p>7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</p>
                    <p>8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord,
                        whether<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bond or
                        free.</p>
                    <p>9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master
                        also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</p>
                    <p>10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>
                    <p>11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
                    </p>
                    <p>12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
                        against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in
                        high<span>&nbsp;</span><em>places</em>.</p>
                    <p>13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil
                        day, and having done all, to stand.</p>
                    <p>14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of
                        righteousness;</p>
                    <p>15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</p>
                    <p>16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery
                        darts of the wicked.</p>
                    <p>17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</p>
                    <p>18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all
                        perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p>
                    <p>19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make
                        known the mystery of the gospel,</p>
                    <p>20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
                    </p>
                    <p>21 But that ye also may know my affairs,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>how I
                        do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all
                        things:</p>
                    <p>22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he might comfort your hearts.</p>
                    <p>23 Peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the brethren, and love with faith,
                        from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>24 Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with all them that love our Lord Jesus
