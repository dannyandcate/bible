                    <p>THE burden of the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to Israel by Malachi.</p>
                    <p>2 I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved
                        us?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not Esau Jacob&rsquo;s brother? saith the
                        Lord: yet I loved Jacob,</p>
                    <p>3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the
                        wilderness.</p>
                    <p>4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus
                        saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they
                        shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lordhath indignation
                        for ever.</p>
                    <p>5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will be magnified from
                        the border of Israel.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A son
                        honoureth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>father, and a servant his master: if
                        then I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a father,
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine honour? and if
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a master,
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my fear? saith the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein
                        have we despised thy name?</p>
                    <p>7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye
                        say, The table of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>contemptible.</p>
                    <p>8 And if ye offer the blind for
                        sacrifice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        evil? and if ye offer the lame and
                        sick,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not evil?
                        offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                    <p>9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your
                        means: will he regard your persons? saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                    <p>10 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>even
                        among you that would shut the
                        doors<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>nought?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>neither
                        do ye kindle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>fire</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on mine altar for nought. I have
                        no pleasure in you, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, neither will I accept an offering
                        at your hand.</p>
                    <p>11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great
                        among the Gentiles; and in every place
                        incense<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>offered
                        unto my name, and a pure offering: for my
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great
                        among the heathen, saith the Lordof hosts.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>polluted; and the fruit
                        thereof,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                        meat,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>contemptible.</p>
                    <p>13 Ye said also, Behold, what a
                        weariness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it!</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and ye
                        have snuffed at it, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; and ye
                        brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>torn,
                        and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand?
                        saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>14 But cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the deceiver, which hath in his
                        flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great King, saith the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, and my
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dreadful among the heathen.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND now, O ye priests, this commandment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, I will even send a
                        curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do
                        not lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to heart.</p>
                    <p>3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
                        faces,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the dung of your solemn feasts;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall take you away with it.</p>
                    <p>4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with
                        Levi, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                    <p>5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the fear wherewith he feared me, and was
                        afraid before my name.</p>
                    <p>6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in
                        peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</p>
                    <p>7 For the priest&rsquo;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth:
                        for he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the messenger of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                    <p>8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have
                        corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                    <p>9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye
                        have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.</p>
                    <p>10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every
                        man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in
                        Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.</p>
                    <p>12 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar,
                        out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                    <p>13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with tears, with
                        weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or
                        receiveth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with good will at your hand.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath been
                        witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously:
                        yet<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she thy companion, and the wife of thy
                        covenant.</p>
                    <p>15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he
                        might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously
                        against the wife of his youth.</p>
                    <p>16 For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>covereth violence with his garment, saith
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not
                        treacherously.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ye have wearied the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with your words. Yet ye
                        say, Wherein have we wearied<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>When ye say,
                        Every one that doeth evil<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good in the sight of
                        the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or,
                        Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the God of judgment?</p>

                    <p>BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye

                    <p>5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers,
                        and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the

                        hosts?</p>
                    <p>15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up;
                        yea,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>tempt God
                        are even delivered.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then they that feared the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake often one to
                        another: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hearkened, and heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and
                        a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought
                        upon his name.</p>
                    <p>17 And they shall be mine, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, in that day when I make up
                        my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</p>
                    <p>18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that
                        serveth God and him that serveth him not.</p>

                    <p>FOR, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do
                        wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.</p>
                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
                        with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</p>
                    <p>3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the
                        day that I shall do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em>, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.

                        judgments.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the
                        great and dreadful day of the Lord:</p>
                    <p>6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to
                        their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</p>
                    <p>THE END OF THE PROPHETS.</p>
