                    <p>THESE<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the words which Moses spake unto all Israel
                        on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the
                        Red<span>&nbsp;</span><em>sea</em>, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and
                        Dizahab.</p>
                    <p>2 (<em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>eleven

                        Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.)</p>
                    <p>3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the
                        first<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                        month,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Moses spake unto the children of
                        Israel, according unto all that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had given him in commandment unto
                        them;</p>
                    <p>4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of
                        Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</p>
                    <p>5 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</p>
                    <p>6 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in
                        this mount:</p>
                    <p>7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>places</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nigh
                        thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side,
                        to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</p>
                    <p>8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and
                        to their seed after them.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able
                        to bear you myself alone:</p>
                    <p>10 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath multiplied you, and, behold,
                        ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day as the stars of heaven for
                        multitude.</p>
                    <p>11 (The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as
                        ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em>, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</p>
                    <p>12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</p>
                    <p>13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers
                        over you.</p>
                    <p>14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast
                        spoken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you,
                        captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains
                        over tens, and officers among your tribes.</p>
                    <p>16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying,
                        Hear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>causes</em><span>&nbsp;</span>between
                        your brethren, and judge righteously
                        between<span>&nbsp;</span><em>every</em><span>&nbsp;</span>man and his brother, and the
                        stranger<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye
                        shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the
                        judgment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God&rsquo;s: and the cause that is too
                        hard for you, bring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto me, and I will hear it.
                    </p>
                    <p>18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
                        great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</p>
                    <p>20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God doth give unto us.</p>
                    <p>21 Behold, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath set the land before thee: go
                        up<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>possess<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, as
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be
                        discouraged.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We
                        will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what
                        way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</p>
                    <p>23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</p>
                    <p>24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and
                        searched it out.</p>
                    <p>25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
                        brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>down unto us, and brought us word again,
                        and said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a good
                        land which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God doth give us.</p>
                    <p>26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God:</p>
                    <p>27 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hated us, he hath
                        brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to
                        destroy us.</p>
                    <p>28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>greater and taller than we; the
                        cities<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great and walled up to heaven; and
                        moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</p>
                    <p>29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</p>
                    <p>30 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according
                        to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</p>
                    <p>31 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God bare
                        thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.
                    </p>
                    <p>32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God,</p>
                    <p>33 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your
                        tents<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em>, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and
                        in a cloud by day.</p>
                    <p>34 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware,
                        saying,</p>
                    <p>35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I
                        sware to give unto your fathers,</p>
                    <p>36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath
                        trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord.</p>
                    <p>37 Also the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not
                        go in thither.</p>
                    <p>38<span>&nbsp;</span><em>But</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before
                        thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</p>
                    <p>39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that
                        day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give
                        it, and they shall possess it.</p>
                    <p>40 But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>you, turn
                        you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
                    <p>41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord, we will go up and fight,
                        according to all that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on
                        every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</p>
                    <p>42 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
                        enemies.</p>
                    <p>43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord,
                        and went presumptuously up into the hill.</p>
                    <p>44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees
                        do, and destroyed you in Seir,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto Hormah.
                    </p>
                    <p>45 And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>would not hearken to
                        your voice, nor give ear unto you.</p>
                    <p>46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
                        abode<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em>.</p>

                    <p>THEN we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the

                        thou hast lacked nothing.</p>
                    <p>8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the
                        way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
                        wilderness of Moab.</p>
                    <p>9 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with
                        them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
                        land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a possession; because I have given Ar unto
                        the children of Lot<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a possession.</p>
                    <p>10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</p>
                    <p>11 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</p>
                    <p>12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they
                        had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
                        his possession, which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>gave unto them.</p>
                    <p>13 Now rise up,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>said</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em>, and get you over
                        the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</p>
                    <p>14 And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook
                        Zered,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thirty and eight years; until all the
                        generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sware unto them.</p>
                    <p>15 For indeed the hand of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was against them, to destroy them from among
                        the host, until they were consumed.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed
                        and dead from among the people,</p>
                    <p>17 That the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto me, saying,</p>
                    <p>18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</p>
                    <p>19 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou comest nigh over against the
                        children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land
                        of the children of Ammon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>possession; because I
                        have given it unto the children of Lot<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        possession.</p>
                    <p>20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites
                        call them Zamzummims;</p>
                    <p>21 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>destroyed
                        them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</p>
                    <p>22 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from
                        before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</p>
                    <p>23 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                        Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their
                        stead.)</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river
                        Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land:
                        begin to possess<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and contend with him in battle.</p>
                    <p>25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the
                        nations<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under
                        the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of
                        thee.</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth
                        unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p>
                    <p>27 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the
                        right hand nor to the left.</p>
                    <p>28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may
                        drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</p>
                    <p>29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto
                        me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God
                        giveth us.</p>
                    <p>30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God
                        hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>appeareth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day.</p>
                    <p>31 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land
                        before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</p>
                    <p>32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</p>
                    <p>33 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his
                        sons, and all his people.</p>
                    <p>34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the
                        little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</p>
                    <p>35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
                    </p>
                    <p>36 From Aroer, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the brink of the river of
                        Arnon, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the city
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the river, even unto Gilead, there was
                        not one city too strong for us: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God delivered all unto us:</p>
                    <p>37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest
                        not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nor</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor
                        unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God forbad

                    <p>THEN we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he
                        and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>
                    <p>2 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his
                        people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of
                        the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
                    <p>3 So the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and
                        all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</p>
                    <p>4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them,
                        threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
                    <p>5 All these cities<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fenced with high walls,
                        gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</p>
                    <p>6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the
                        men, women, and children, of every city.</p>
                    <p>7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on this side Jordan, from the river of
                        Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p>
                    <p>9 (<em>Which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it

                    <p>10 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of
                        the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
                    <p>11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his
                        bedstead<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a bedstead of
                        iron;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it not in Rabbath of the children of
                        Ammon? nine cubits<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the length thereof, and four
                        cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</p>
                    <p>12 And this land,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>we possessed at that time,
                        from Aroer, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the river Arnon, and half
                        mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</p>
                    <p>13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan,
                        which was called the land of giants.</p>
                    <p>14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and
                        Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.</p>
                    <p>15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</p>
                    <p>16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half
                        the valley, and the border even unto the river
                        Jabbok,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                        even unto the sea of the plain,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the salt sea,
                        under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The

                    <p>19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I know
                        that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</p>
                    <p>20 Until the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>until</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they also possess the land which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath given them beyond Jordan:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall ye return every man unto his
                        possession, which I have given you.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes

                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</p>
                    <p>22 Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God he shall fight for you.</p>
                    <p>23 And I besought the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>at that time, saying,</p>
                    <p>24 O Lord God, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in heaven
                        or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</p>
                    <p>25 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and
                        Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>26 But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and
                        southward, and eastward, and behold<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thine
                        eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
                    <p>28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this
                        people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</p>
                    <p>29 So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.</p>

                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>we call
                        upon him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for?</em></p>
                    <p>8 And what
                        nation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great,
                        that hath statutes and judgments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>righteous as
                        all this law, which I set before you this day?</p>
                    <p>9 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which
                        thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach
                        them thy sons, and thy sons&rsquo; sons;</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Specially</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the day that thou stoodest before the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God in Horeb, when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Gather me
                        the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the
                        days that they shall live upon the earth, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em>they may teach
                        their children.</p>
                    <p>11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the
                        midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</p>
                    <p>12 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice
                        of the words, but saw no similitude;
                        only<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>heard</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a voice.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
                        perform,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ten commandments; and he wrote them
                        upon two tables of stone.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded me at that time
                        to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
                        possess it.</p>
                    <p>15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the
                        day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto you
                        in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</p>
                    <p>16 Lest ye corrupt<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yourselves</em>, and make you a graven image, the
                        similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</p>
                    <p>17 The likeness of any beast that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the earth,
                        the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,</p>
                    <p>18 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the waters beneath the earth:</p>
                    <p>19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and
                        the stars,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the host of heaven, shouldest
                        be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath divided
                        unto all nations under the whole heaven.</p>
                    <p>20 But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
                        furnace,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of Egypt, to be unto him a people
                        of inheritance,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day.</p>
                    <p>21 Furthermore the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I
                        should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God giveth thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                        inheritance:</p>
                    <p>22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that
                        good land.</p>
                    <p>23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God,
                        which he made with you, and make you a graven
                        image,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the likeness of
                        any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em>, which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath forbidden
                        thee.</p>
                    <p>24 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        consuming fire,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a jealous God.</p>
                    <p>25<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>When thou shalt beget children, and children&rsquo;s

                        corrupt<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yourselves</em>, and make a graven
                        image,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the likeness of

                    <p>26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish
                        from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not
                        prolong<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days upon it, but shall utterly be
                        destroyed.</p>
                    <p>27 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few

                    <p>28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men&rsquo;s hands, wood and stone, which neither
                        see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</p>
                    <p>29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, thou shalt
                        find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
                    </p>
                    <p>30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon

                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;</p>
                    <p>31 (For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy

                    <p>32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created
                        man upon the earth, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ask</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the one side of
                        heaven unto the other, whether there hath
                        been<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>such</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        this great thing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>, or hath been heard like it?</p>
                    <p>33 Did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ever</em><span>&nbsp;</span>people hear the voice of God speaking
                        out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?</p>
                    <p>34 Or hath God assayed to go<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>take him a nation
                        from the midst of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>another</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nation, by temptations,
                        by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by
                        great terrors, according to all that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God did for you in Egypt
                        before your eyes?</p>
                    <p>35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                        else beside him.</p>
                    <p>36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he
                        shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.</p>
                    <p>37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee
                        out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;</p>
                    <p>38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em>, to bring thee in, to give thee their
                        land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an inheritance,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day.</p>
                    <p>39 Know therefore this day, and consider<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in thine
                        heart, that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God in
                        heaven above, and upon the earth

                        else.</p>
                    <p>40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day,
                        that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest
                        prolong<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days upon the earth, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God giveth thee, for ever.</p>
                    <p>41<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan
                        toward the sunrising;</p>
                    <p>42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him
                        not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:</p>

                        Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.</p>
                    <p>44<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the law which Moses set before the children

                    <p>45 These<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the testimonies, and the statutes, and
                        the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of
                        Egypt,</p>
                    <p>46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the
                        Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were
                        come forth out of Egypt:</p>
                    <p>47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on this side Jordan toward the
                        sunrising;</p>
                    <p>48 From Aroer, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the bank of the river

                        I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.</p>
                    <p>2 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.</p>
                    <p>3 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>made not this covenant with our fathers, but with
                        us,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>us,

                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>within thy gates; that thy manservant and

                    <p>15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,

                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Honour thy father and thy mother, as the

                        may go well with thee, in the land which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God giveth thee.</p>
                    <p>17 Thou shalt not kill.</p>
                    <p>18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.</p>
                    <p>19 Neither shalt thou steal.</p>

                        neighbour&rsquo;s.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>These words the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto all
                        your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
                        darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone,
                        and delivered them unto me.</p>
                    <p>23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the
                        mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto
                        me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the heads of your tribes, and your
                        elders;</p>
                    <p>24 And ye said, Behold, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God hath shewed us his glory and his
                        greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that
                        God doth talk with man, and he liveth.</p>
                    <p>25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God any more, then we shall die.</p>
                    <p>26 For

                        flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as
                        we<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em>, and lived?</p>
                    <p>27 Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God shall say: and speak thou
                        unto us all that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God shall speak unto thee; and we will
                        hear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>28 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which
                        they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.</p>
                    <p>29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments
                        always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!</p>
                    <p>30 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.</p>
                    <p>31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and
                        the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may
                        do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land which I give them to possess
                        it.</p>
                    <p>32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath commanded you: ye
                        shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</p>
                    <p>33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath commanded you,

                    <p>21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh&rsquo;s bondmen in Egypt; and the

                        shall the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.</p>
                    <p>20 Moreover the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that
                        are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among you, a mighty God and terrible.</p>
                    <p>22 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and
                        little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
                    </p>
                    <p>23 But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them
                        with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under
                        heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.</p>
                    <p>25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or
                        gold<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on them,
                        nor take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto thee, lest thou be snared therein:
                        for it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an abomination to the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God.</p>
                    <p>26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like
                        it:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou
                        shalt utterly abhor it; for it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a cursed thing.

                    <p>2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God led thee these
                        forty years in the wilderness, to humble
                        thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to prove thee, to know

                    <p>3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest
                        not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread

                    <p>7 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of

                    <p>8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive,
                        and honey;</p>
                    <p>9 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack
                        any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in it; a land whose

                        dig brass.</p>
                    <p>10 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God
                        for the good land which he hath given thee.</p>
                    <p>11 Beware that thou forget not the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, in not keeping his

                    <p>15 Who led thee through that great and terrible

                    <p>17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might

                    <p>HEAR, O Israel: Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to pass over Jordan this
                        day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up
                        to heaven,</p>
                    <p>2 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest,

                        quickly, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath said unto thee.</p>
                    <p>4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath cast them out
                        from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath brought me in to

                        stiffnecked people.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Remember,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forget
                        not, how thou provokedst the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the
                        day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been
                        rebellious against the Lord.</p>
                    <p>8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to wrath, so that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was angry with you to have destroyed you.</p>
                    <p>9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
                        stone,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the tables of the covenant which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I
                        neither did eat bread nor drink water:</p>
                    <p>10 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger
                        of God; and on
                        them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>written</em><span>&nbsp;</span>according
                        to all the words, which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake with you in the mount out of the midst
                        of the fire in the day of the assembly.</p>
                    <p>11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty
                        nights,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>gave me the
                        two tables of stone,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the tables of the
                        covenant.</p>
                    <p>12 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy
                        people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have
                        corrupted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>themselves;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they are quickly turned aside
                        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</p>
                    <p>13 Furthermore the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and,
                        behold, it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a stiffnecked people:</p>
                    <p>14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will
                        make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</p>
                    <p>15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables
                        of the covenant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in my two hands.</p>
                    <p>16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your
                        God,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>had made you a molten calf: ye had turned
                        aside quickly out of the way which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had commanded you.</p>
                    <p>17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>18 And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither
                        eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the
                        sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.</p>
                    <p>19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was
                        wroth against you to destroy you. But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hearkened unto me at that time
                        also.</p>
                    <p>20 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed
                        for Aaron also the same time.</p>
                    <p>21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped
                        it,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ground<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very
                        small,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>until it was as small as dust: and I
                        cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</p>
                    <p>22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to wrath.</p>
                    <p>23 Likewise when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and
                        possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</p>
                    <p>24 Ye have been rebellious against the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>from the day that I knew you.</p>
                    <p>25 Thus I fell down before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>forty days and forty nights, as I fell
                        down<span>&nbsp;</span><em>at</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>first;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>because
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had said he would destroy you.</p>
                    <p>26 I prayed therefore unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, destroy not thy people and thine
                        inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out
                        of Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>
                    <p>27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this
                        people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</p>
                    <p>28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was not
                        able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath
                        brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>29 Yet they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy people and thine inheritance,
                        which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</p>

                        first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.</p>
                    <p>2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and
                        thou shalt put them in the ark.</p>
                    <p>3 And I made an ark<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shittim wood, and hewed two
                        tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of
                        the assembly: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>gave them unto me.</p>
                    <p>5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had
                        made; and there they be, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded me.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth
                        of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his
                        son ministered in the priest&rsquo;s office in his stead.</p>
                    <p>7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of
                        waters.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>At that time the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>separated the
                        tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.</p>
                    <p>9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his inheritance, according as the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God promised him.</p>
                    <p>10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hearkened unto me at that time
                        also,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>would not
                        destroy thee.</p>
                    <p>11 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Arise,
                        take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>journey before the people, that they may
                        go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And now, Israel, what doth the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        God require of thee, but to fear the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, to walk in all his ways,
                        and to love him, and to serve the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God with all thy heart and with all
                        thy soul,</p>
                    <p>13 To keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy
                        good?</p>
                    <p>14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of
                        heavens<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord&rsquo;s thy God, the
                        earth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>also</em>, with all that therein<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>.</p>
                    <p>15 Only the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their
                        seed after them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>you above all people,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day.</p>
                    <p>16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.</p>
                    <p>17 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God of
                        gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor
                        taketh reward:</p>
                    <p>18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving
                        him food and raiment.</p>
                    <p>19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>20 Thou shalt fear the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt
                        thou cleave, and swear by his name.</p>
                    <p>21 He<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy praise, and
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, that hath done for thee these great
                        and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.</p>
                    <p>22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>

                        turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have

                    <p>13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:

                    <p>15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth

                        the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.</p>
                    <p>16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy

                        to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</p>
                    <p>21 If the place which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too
                        far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the

                    <p>22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean

                    <p>25 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when

                        in the sight of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>26 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place
                        which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall choose:</p>
                    <p>27 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the

                        unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they

                    <p>8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his

                        and he cry unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>against thee, and it be sin unto thee.</p>
                    <p>10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him:

                        Israel:</p>
                    <p>5 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing,

                        shalt stone them with stones, till they die.</p>
                    <p>6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to
                        death;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the mouth of one witness he shall not
                        be put to death.</p>
                    <p>7 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands
                        of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment,
                        between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and

                        gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God shall choose;</p>
                    <p>9 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those
                        days, and inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:</p>
                    <p>10 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to
                        all that they inform thee:</p>
                    <p>11 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the
                        judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence

                        die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.</p>

                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>When thou art come unto the land which the

                        shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>about me;</p>
                    <p>15 Thou shalt in any wise set<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>king over thee,

                        king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not thy brother.</p>
                    <p>16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the

                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three

                    <p>7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God.</p>
                    <p>8 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all
                        Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God.</p>
                    <p>10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, and do his
                        commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,</p>
                    <p>12 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan;
                        Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>
                    <p>13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and
                        Naphtali.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of

                    <p>34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</p>
                    <p>35 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch
                        that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.</p>
                    <p>36 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto

                        wood and stone.</p>
                    <p>37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the

                    <p>38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt

                        the worms shall eat them.</p>

                        cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>fruit</em>.</p>
                    <p>41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into
                        captivity.</p>
                    <p>42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.</p>

                    <p>45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till
                        thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy

                    <p>46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.</p>
                    <p>47 Because thou servedst not the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God with joyfulness, and with
                        gladness of heart, for the abundance of all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things;</em></p>
                    <p>48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall send against
                        thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and he shall put a yoke of iron upon

                    <p>49 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the

                    <p>50 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour
                        to the young:</p>
                    <p>51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed:

                    <p>52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein
                        thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout
                        all thy land, which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath given thee.</p>
                    <p>53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters,
                        which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness,
                        wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:</p>

                        you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his
                        bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:</p>
                    <p>55 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat:
                        because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies
                        shall distress thee in all thy gates.</p>
                    <p>56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot
                        upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her
                        bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</p>
                    <p>57 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which
                        she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>secretly in the siege and straitness,
                        wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</p>
                    <p>58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that
                        thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;</p>
                    <p>59 Then the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy
                        seed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great plagues, and of long continuance,
                        and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</p>
                    <p>60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and
                        they shall cleave unto thee.</p>
                    <p>61 Also every sickness, and every plague,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not written in the book of this law, them
                        will the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude;
                        because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God.</p>
                    <p>63 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye
                        shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
                    <p>64 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the
                        earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy
                        fathers have known,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wood and stone.</p>
                    <p>65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest:
                        but the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and
                        sorrow of mind:</p>
                    <p>66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt
                        have none assurance of thy life:</p>
                    <p>67 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God
                        it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
                        thine eyes which thou shalt see.</p>
                    <p>68 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way
                        whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your
                        enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em>.</p>

                    <p>THESE<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the words of the covenant, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
                        beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.</p>
                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye
                        have seen all that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto
                        Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;</p>

                        ears to hear, unto this day.</p>
                    <p>5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and

                    <p>28 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in
                        great indignation, and cast them into another land,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day.</p>

                    <p>7 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on
                        them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.</p>
                    <p>8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his commandments which I
                        command thee this day.</p>
                    <p>9 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in
                        the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good:
                        for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
                        fathers:</p>
                    <p>10 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, to keep his
                        commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the
                        law,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>if thou turn unto the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>For this commandment which I command thee this day,
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not hidden from thee,
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it far off.</p>
                    <p>12 It<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who
                        shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</p>
                    <p>13 Neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest
                        say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</p>
                    <p>14 But the word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very nigh unto thee, in thy
                        mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and
                        death and evil;</p>
                    <p>16 In that I command thee this day to love the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, to walk in his
                        ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and
                        multiply: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest
                        to possess it.</p>
                    <p>17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship
                        other gods, and serve them;</p>
                    <p>18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely
                        perish,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye
                        shall not prolong<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days upon the land, whither
                        thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.</p>
                    <p>19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against
                        you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have set before you life and death,
                        blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
                    <p>20 That thou mayest love the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        God,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that thou mayest obey his voice, and that
                        thou mayest cleave unto him: for he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy life,
                        and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

                    <p>AND Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.</p>
                    <p>2 And he said unto them, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an hundred and twenty
                        years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath said
                        unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
                    <p>3 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, he will go over before
                        thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he will destroy these nations from before
                        thee, and thou shalt possess them:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Joshua, he
                        shall go over before thee, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath said.</p>
                    <p>4 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the
                        Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.</p>
                    <p>5 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them
                        according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.</p>
                    <p>6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God,
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that doth go
                        with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the
                        sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the
                        land which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt
                        cause them to inherit it.</p>
                    <p>8 And the Lord,

                        before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not,

                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the

                        elders of Israel.</p>
                    <p>10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>every</em><span>&nbsp;</span>seven years, in the solemnity of the year
                        of release, in the feast of tabernacles,</p>
                    <p>11 When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God in the place which
                        he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</p>
                    <p>12 Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>within thy gates, that they may hear, and
                        that they may learn, and fear the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, and observe to do all the
                        words of this law:</p>
                    <p>13 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their children, which have not
                        known<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em>, may hear, and learn to
                        fear the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over
                        Jordan to possess it.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Moses, Behold,
                        thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of
                        the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented
                        themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
                    <p>15 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the
                        pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Moses, Behold,
                        thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
                        of the strangers of the land, whither they
                        go<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among them, and
                        will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</p>
                    <p>17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will
                        hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall
                        them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not among us?</p>
                    <p>18 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in
                        that they are turned unto other gods.</p>
                    <p>19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their
                        mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that
                        floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat;
                        then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</p>
                    <p>21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song
                        shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of
                        their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought
                        them into the land which I sware.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught
                        it the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for
                        thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be
                        with thee.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of
                        writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</p>
                    <p>25 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,</p>
                    <p>26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</p>
                    <p>27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day,
                        ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death?</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
                        officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record
                        against them.</p>
                    <p>29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yourselves</em>,
                        and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter
                        days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work
                        of your hands.</p>
                    <p>30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until
                        they were ended.</p>

                    <p>17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to
                        new<span>&nbsp;</span><em>gods</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>came newly
                        up, whom your fathers feared not.</p>
                    <p>18 Of the Rock<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>begat thee thou art unmindful,
                        and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</p>
                    <p>19 And when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saw<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, he
                        abhorred<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his
                        daughters.</p>
                    <p>20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their
                        end<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a very froward generation, children in
                        whom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no faith.</p>
                    <p>21 They have moved me to jealousy
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>those</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p>
                    <p>22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume
                        the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</p>
                    <p>23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><em>They</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>burnt
                        with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the
                        teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</p>
                    <p>25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the
                        suckling<span>&nbsp;</span><em>also</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the man of gray hairs.</p>
                    <p>26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from
                        among men:</p>
                    <p>27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave
                        themselves strangely,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lest they should say, Our
                        hand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>high, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath
                        not done all this.</p>
                    <p>28 For they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a nation void of counsel,
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>understanding
                        in them.</p>
                    <p>29 O that they were wise,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they understood
                        this,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they would consider their latter end!
                    </p>
                    <p>30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had
                        sold them, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had shut them up?</p>
                    <p>31 For their rock<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not as our Rock, even our
                        enemies themselves<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>judges.</p>
                    <p>32 For their vine<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the vine of Sodom, and of
                        the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>grapes of
                        gall, their clusters<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bitter:</p>
                    <p>33 Their wine<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the poison of dragons, and the
                        cruel venom of asps.</p>
                    <p>34<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not this laid up in store with
                        me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sealed up among my treasures?</p>
                    <p>35 To me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belongeth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vengeance, and recompence; their
                        foot shall slide in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>due</em><span>&nbsp;</span>time: for the day of their
                        calamity<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at hand, and the things that shall come
                        upon them make haste.</p>
                    <p>36 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants,
                        when he seeth that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>power is gone,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none shut
                        up, or left.</p>
                    <p>37 And he shall say, Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their
                        gods,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rock in whom they trusted,</p>
                    <p>38 Which did eat the fat of their
                        sacrifices,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>drank the wine of their drink
                        offerings? let them rise up and help you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be
                        your protection.</p>
                    <p>39 See now that
                        I,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no god with
                        me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal:
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        can deliver out of my hand.</p>
                    <p>40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</p>
                    <p>41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to
                        mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</p>
                    <p>42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour
                        flesh;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the
                        blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</p>
                    <p>43 Rejoice, O ye nations,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his people: for he
                        will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be
                        merciful unto his land,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his people.</p>
                    <p>44<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in
                        the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</p>
                    <p>45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</p>
                    <p>46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day,
                        which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</p>
                    <p>47 For it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a vain thing for you; because
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your life: and through this thing ye shall
                        prolong<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days in the land, whither ye go over
                        Jordan to possess it.</p>
                    <p>48 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</p>
                    <p>49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mount
                        Nebo, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of Moab,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over against Jericho; and behold the land
                        of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</p>
                    <p>50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy
                        brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</p>
                    <p>51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh,
                        in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
                    </p>
                    <p>52 Yet thou shalt see the land before<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but thou
                        shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</p>

                        God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</p>
                    <p>2 And he said, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he
                        shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right

                    <p>4 Moses commanded us a law,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the inheritance of
                        the congregation of Jacob.</p>
                    <p>5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the tribes of Israel were gathered

                    <p>21 And he provided the first part for himself, because
                        there,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a portion of the

                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And of Dan he said,
                        Dan<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a lion&rsquo;s whelp: he shall leap from
                        Bashan.</p>
                    <p>23<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with
                        favour, and full with the blessing of the Lord: possess thou the west and the south.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And of Asher he
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Asher<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blessed

                    <p>25 Thy

                    <p>27 The eternal

                    </p>
                    <p>28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of

                    <p>29 Happy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou, O Israel:

                    <h1>The Fifth Book of Moses Called Deuteronomy<br /><a
                            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+34&version=NIV"

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over against Jericho. And the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,</p>
                    <p>2 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the
                        utmost sea,</p>
                    <p>3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</p>
                    <p>4 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him,
                        This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto
                        Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to
                        see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over
                        thither.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Moses the servant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>died
                        there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth
                        of his sepulchre unto this day.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And
                        Moses<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an hundred and twenty years old when he
                        died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
                        Moab thirty days: so the days of
                        weeping<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mourning for Moses were ended.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of
                        wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him,
                        and did as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Moses.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto
                        Moses, whom the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>knew face to face,</p>
                    <p>11 In all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent him to do in the land
                        of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</p>
                    <p>12 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of
                        all Israel.</p>
