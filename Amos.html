                    <p>THE words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days
                        of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years
                        before the earthquake.</p>
                    <p>2 And he said, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from
                        Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
                    </p>
                    <p>3 Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn
                        away<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>punishment</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thereof;
                        because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</p>
                    <p>4 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
                    </p>
                    <p>5 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and
                        him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into
                        captivity unto Kir, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I
                        will not turn
                        away<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>punishment</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thereof;
                        because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to
                        deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up to Edom:</p>
                    <p>7 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:</p>
                    <p>8 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon,
                        and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith
                        the Lord God.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I
                        will not turn
                        away<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>punishment</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thereof;
                        because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly
                        covenant:</p>
                    <p>10 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>

                        tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</p>
                    <p>12 But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord; For three transgressions of the children of
                        Ammon, and for four, I will not turn
                        away<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>punishment</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thereof;
                        because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their
                        border:</p>
                    <p>14 But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with
                        shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</p>
                    <p>15 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the Lord.</p>

                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose

                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his
                        fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</p>
                    <p>10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness,

                    <p>12 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</p>
                    <p>13 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is

                    <p>HEAR this word that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken against you, O children of Israel,
                        against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
                    <p>2 You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all
                        your iniquities.</p>
                    <p>3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</p>
                    <p>4 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if
                        he have taken nothing?</p>
                    <p>5 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no

                        shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>take up a snare from the earth, and have
                        taken nothing at all?</p>
                    <p>6 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a

                    <p>7 Surely the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his

                    <p>8 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken, who can
                        but prophesy?</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of
                        Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults
                        in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.</p>
                    <p>10 For they know not to do right, saith the Lord, who store up violence and robbery in their
                        palaces.</p>
                    <p>11 Therefore thus saith the Lord God; An

                        spoiled.</p>
                    <p>12 Thus saith the Lord; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece
                        of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a

                    <p>15 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish,
                        and the great houses shall have an end, saith the Lord.</p>

                    <p>10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain
                        with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come
                        up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>11 I have overthrown<span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of you, as God overthrew
                        Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not
                        returned unto me, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>12 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O
                        Israel:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>because I will do this unto thee,
                        prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</p>
                    <p>13 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his thought, that maketh the morning
                        darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The Lord, The God of

                    <p>HEAR ye this word which I take up against
                        you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>
                    <p>2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her
                        land;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none to

                    <p>3 For thus saith the Lord God; The city that went
                        out<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that
                        which went forth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an hundred shall leave ten, to
                        the house of Israel.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto the house of Israel,
                        Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</p>
                    <p>5 But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall
                        surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.</p>
                    <p>6 Seek the Lord, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and
                        devour<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none to
                        quench<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Beth-el.</p>
                    <p>7 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Seek</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that maketh
                        the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day
                        dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of
                        the earth: The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name:</p>
                    <p>9 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the
                        fortress.</p>
                    <p>10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</p>
                    <p>11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the
                        poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall
                        not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</p>
                    <p>12 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take
                        a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the
                        gate<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>right</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an evil time.</p>
                    <p>14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the Lord, the God of hosts, shall be with
                        you, as ye have spoken.</p>
                    <p>15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</p>
                    <p>16 Therefore the Lord, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus;
                        Wailing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all
                        streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman
                        to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</p>
                    <p>17 And in all
                        vineyards<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wailing:
                        for I will pass through thee, saith the Lord.</p>

                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>darkness, and not light.</p>
                    <p>19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his
                        hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not the day of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>darkness, and not light? even very dark,
                        and no brightness in it?</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn
                        assemblies.</p>
                    <p>22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not

                        offerings of your fat beasts.</p>
                    <p>23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
                    </p>
                    <p>24 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>
                    <p>25 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of
                        Israel?</p>
                    <p>26 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god,
                        which ye made to yourselves.</p>
                    <p>27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, whose

                    <p>THUS hath the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in

                        the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and
                        did eat up a part.</p>
                    <p>5 Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for

                    <p>6 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord God.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a
                        wall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>made</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>8 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline.
                        Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not
                        again pass by them any more:</p>
                    <p>9 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid
                        waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel,
                        saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not
                        able to bear all his words.</p>
                    <p>11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away
                        captive out of their own land.</p>
                    <p>12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there
                        eat bread, and prophesy there:</p>
                    <p>13 But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king&rsquo;s chapel, and
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king&rsquo;s court.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no prophet,
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I a prophet&rsquo;s son; but
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
                    </p>
                    <p>15 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>took me as I followed the flock, and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, Prophesy
                        not against Israel, and drop
                        not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>word</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against the
                        house of Isaac.</p>
                    <p>17 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy
                        daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in
                        a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</p>

                    <p>2 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass
                        by them any more.</p>
                    <p>3 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord
                        God:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>many
                        dead bodies in every place; they shall
                        cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forth with silence.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the
                        land to fail,</p>
                    <p>5 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set
                        forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by
                        deceit?</p>
                    <p>6 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of
                        shoes;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yea</em>, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</p>
                    <p>7 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget
                        any of their works.</p>
                    <p>8 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall
                        rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the flood of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>9 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that I will cause the sun to go down
                        at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:</p>
                    <p>10 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will
                        bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the
                        mourning of an only<span>&nbsp;</span><em>son</em>, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine
                        in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the
                        Lord:</p>
                    <p>12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to
                        and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>13 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.</p>
                    <p>14 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of
                        Beer-sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>I SAW the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts
                        may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the
                        sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be
                        delivered.</p>
                    <p>2 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven,
                        thence will I bring them down:</p>
                    <p>3 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence;
                        and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the
                        serpent, and he shall bite them:</p>
                    <p>4 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it
                        shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</p>
                    <p>5 And the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he
                        that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall
                        rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the flood of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that buildeth
                        his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the
                        waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me,
                        O children of Israel? saith the Lord. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and
                        the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</p>
                    <p>8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the
                        sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not
                        utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>9 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>corn</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the
                        least grain fall upon the earth.</p>
                    <p>10 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake
                        nor prevent us.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen,
                        and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the
                        days of old:</p>
                    <p>12 That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my
                        name, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that doeth this.</p>
                    <p>13 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the
                        treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the
                        hills shall melt.</p>
                    <p>14 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste
                        cities, and inhabit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and they shall plant
                        vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land
                        which I have given them, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God.</p>
