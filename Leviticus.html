                    <p><span>AND the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>

                    <p><span>3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him

                            the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
                            offering, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>at</em>&nbsp;the door of the tabernacle of the

                    <p><span>19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the

                    <p><span>20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall
                            he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven
                            them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the

                    <p><span>23 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his
                            offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they
                            kill the burnt offering before the Lord: it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a sin offering.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and
                            put&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out
                            his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace
                            offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it
                            shall be forgiven him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27&nbsp;&nbsp;And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he
                            doeth&nbsp;<em>somewhat</em>&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;any of the commandments of the
                            Lord&nbsp;<em>concerning</em>&nbsp;<em>things</em>&nbsp;which ought not to be done, and be
                            guilty;</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his
                            offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath
                            sinned.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering
                            in the place of the burnt offering.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and
                            put&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out

                            sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the altar
                            for a sweet savour unto the Lord; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it

                    <p><span>32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without
                            blemish.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin
                            offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and
                            put&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out
                            all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:</span></p>
                    <p><span>35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from
                            the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar,
                            according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord: and the priest shall make an
                            atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.</span></p>

                            flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a

                            the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement
                            for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17&nbsp;&nbsp;And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be
                            done by the commandments of the Lord; though he wist&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;not, yet is he
                            guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
                            trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
                            concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;not, and it shall
                            be forgiven him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the
                            Lord.</span></p>

                    <p><span>10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon
                            his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the

                    <p><span>11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes
                            without the camp unto a clean place.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the
                            priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and

                    <p><span>15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil
                            thereof, and all the frankincense which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;upon the meat offering, and

                    <p><span>22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer
                            it:&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a statute for ever unto the Lord; it shall be
                            wholly burnt.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be
                            eaten.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the law of the sin
                            offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed
                            before the Lord: it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;most holy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten,
                            in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of
                            the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the
                            holy place.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a
                            brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;most
                            holy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And no sin offering, whereof&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;of the blood is brought into the
                            tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile&nbsp;<em>withal</em>&nbsp;in the

                    <p><span>30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord&nbsp;made by fire, the fat with the
                            breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;a wave
                            offering before the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron&rsquo;s
                            and his sons&rsquo;.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;an heave

                    <p><span>33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat,
                            shall have the right shoulder for&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;part.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from
                            off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and
                            unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>portion</em>&nbsp;of the
                            anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the
                            Lord&nbsp;made by fire, in the day&nbsp;<em>when</em>&nbsp;he presented them to minister
                            unto the Lord&nbsp;in the priest&rsquo;s office;</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 Which the Lord&nbsp;commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day
                            that he anointed them,&nbsp;<em>by</em>&nbsp;a statute for ever throughout their
                            generations.</span></p>
                    <p><span>37 This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of
                            the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the
                            sacrifice of the peace offerings;</span></p>
                    <p><span>38 Which the Lord&nbsp;commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the
                            children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of

                    <p><span>AND the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock
                            for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;</span></p>

                    <p><span>6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the

                    <p><span>8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the

                    <p><span>11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his

                    <p><span>12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron&rsquo;s head, and anointed him, to

                    <p><span>13 And Moses brought Aaron&rsquo;s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with

                    <p><span>14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands
                            upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And he slew&nbsp;<em>it;</em>&nbsp;and Moses took the blood, and

                    <p><span>17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the

                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid

                    <p><span>19 And he killed&nbsp;<em>it;</em>&nbsp;and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round

                    <p><span>20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the

                    <p><span>21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the

                    <p><span>22&nbsp;&nbsp;And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons
                            laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And he slew&nbsp;<em>it;</em>&nbsp;and Moses took of the blood of it, and
                            put&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the tip of Aaron&rsquo;s right ear, and upon the thumb of his
                            right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And he brought Aaron&rsquo;s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their
                            right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right
                            feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;upon the
                            inwards, and the caul&nbsp;<em>above</em>&nbsp;the liver, and the two kidneys, and their
                            fat, and the right shoulder:</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;before the Lord,
                            he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and
                            put&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And he put all upon Aaron&rsquo;s hands, and upon his sons&rsquo; hands, and waved
                            them&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;a wave offering before the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;on the altar
                            upon the burnt offering: they&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;consecrations for a sweet savour:
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;an offering made by fire unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;a wave offering before
                            the Lord:&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;of the ram of consecration it was Moses&rsquo; part; as the
                            Lord&nbsp;commanded Moses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;upon
                            the altar, and sprinkled&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon Aaron,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;upon his
                            garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons&rsquo; garments with him; and sanctified
                            Aaron,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;his garments, and his sons, and his sons&rsquo; garments with
                            him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31&nbsp;&nbsp;And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the
                            flesh&nbsp;<em>at</em>&nbsp;the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it
                            with the bread that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded,
                            saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
                            congregation&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an
                            end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 As he hath done this day,&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;hath commanded to do, to
                            make an atonement for you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35 Therefore shall ye abide&nbsp;<em>at</em>&nbsp;the door of the tabernacle of the
                            congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not: for
                            so I am commanded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord&nbsp;commanded by the hand of
                            Moses.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND it came to pass on the eighth day,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;Moses called Aaron and his
                            sons, and the elders of Israel;</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt
                            offering, without blemish, and offer&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;before the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for

                    <p><span>4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord; and a meat
                            offering mingled with oil: for to day the Lord&nbsp;will appear unto you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;And they brought&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;which Moses commanded before the

                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And Moses said, This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the thing which the Lord&nbsp;commanded that

                    <p><span>9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood,
                            and put&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the
                            bottom of the altar:</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt
                            upon the altar; as the Lord&nbsp;commanded Moses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons presented unto him the blood,

                    <p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;And he brought the people&rsquo;s offering, and took the goat,

                    <p><span>17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and
                            burnt&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the

                    <p><span>18 He slew also the bullock and the ram&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;a sacrifice of peace

                    <p><span>22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from
                            offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and
                            blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord&nbsp;appeared unto all the people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt

                    <p><span>AND Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire
                            therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he
                            commanded them not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;that the
                            Lord&nbsp;spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the
                            people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said
                            unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had
                            said.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your
                            heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but
                            let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord&nbsp;hath
                            kindled.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die:
                            for the anointing oil of the Lord&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;upon you. And they did according to
                            the word of Moses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Aaron, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the
                            tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye
                            die:&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a statute for ever
                            throughout your generations:</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and
                            clean;</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord&nbsp;hath
                            spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that
                            were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the Lord&nbsp;made by
                            fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;most
                            holy:</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;thy due, and thy
                            sons&rsquo; due, of the sacrifices of the Lord&nbsp;made by fire: for so I am
                            commanded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy
                            sons, and thy daughters with thee: for&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;thy due, and
                            thy sons&rsquo; due,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;are given out of the sacrifices of peace
                            offerings of the children of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire
                            of the fat, to wave&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;a wave offering before the Lord;
                            and it shall be thine, and thy sons&rsquo; with thee, by a statute for ever; as the
                            Lord&nbsp;hath commanded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was
                            burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of
                            Aaron&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;left&nbsp;<em>alive</em>, saying,</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;most holy, and&nbsp;<em>God</em>&nbsp;hath given it you to bear the
                            iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy&nbsp;<em>place:</em>&nbsp;ye
                            should indeed have eaten it in the holy&nbsp;<em>place</em>, as I commanded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and
                            their burnt offering before the Lord; and such things have befallen me:
                            and&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted
                            in the sight of the Lord?</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And when Moses heard&nbsp;<em>that</em>, he was content.</span></p>

                    <p><span>42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;four,
                            or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye
                            shall not eat; for they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;an abomination.</span></p>
                    <p><span>43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither
                            shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.</span></p>
                    <p><span>44 For I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
                            yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;holy: neither shall ye defile
                            yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</span></p>
                    <p><span>45 For I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,
                            to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;holy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>46 This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living
                            creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the
                            earth:</span></p>
                    <p><span>47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may
                            be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</span></p>

                            child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her

                    <p><span>37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;there is black

                    <p><span>42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore;
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold,&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;the rising of the
                            sore&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the
                            leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;</span></p>
                    <p><span>44 He is a leprous man, he&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;unclean: the priest shall pronounce him
                            utterly unclean; his plague&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in his head.</span></p>
                    <p><span>45 And the leper in whom the plague&nbsp;<em>is</em>, his clothes shall be rent, and his
                            head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean,
                            unclean.</span></p>
                    <p><span>46 All the days wherein the plague&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;in him he
                            shall be defiled; he&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the

                    <p><span>47&nbsp;&nbsp;The garment also that the plague of leprosy is
                            in,&nbsp;<em>whether</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a woollen garment, or a

                    <p><span>48 Whether&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of

                    <p><span>49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the
                            warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a plague of leprosy,
                            and shall be shewed unto the priest:</span></p>
                    <p><span>50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut
                            up&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>hath</em>&nbsp;the plague seven days:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the
                            garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin,&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;in any work
                            that is made of skin; the plague&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a fretting leprosy;
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;unclean.</span></p>
                    <p><span>52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or
                            any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a fretting leprosy;
                            it shall be burnt in the fire.</span></p>
                    <p><span>53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment,
                            either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;</span></p>
                    <p><span>54 Then the priest shall command that they
                            wash&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>thing</em>&nbsp;wherein the plague&nbsp;<em>is</em>, and he
                            shall shut it up seven days more:</span></p>
                    <p><span>55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and,
                            behold,&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not
                            spread; it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire;
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;fret
                            inward,&nbsp;<em>whether</em>&nbsp;it&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;bare within or without.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;somewhat dark
                            after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or
                            out of the warp, or out of the woof:</span></p>
                    <p><span>57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any
                            thing of skin; it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a spreading&nbsp;<em>plague:</em>&nbsp;thou shalt
                            burn that wherein the plague&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;with fire.</span></p>
                    <p><span>58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
                            skin&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed
                            from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.</span></p>
                    <p><span>59 This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or
                            linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to
                            pronounce it unclean.</span></p>

                            the priest:</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and,

                    <p><span>35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to

                    <p><span>36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest
                            go&nbsp;<em>into</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;to see the plague, that all
                            that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall
                            go in to see the house:</span></p>
                    <p><span>37 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold,&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;the
                            plague&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or

                    <p><span>38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the
                            house seven days:</span></p>
                    <p><span>39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and,
                            behold,&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;the plague be spread in the walls of the house;</span></p>
                    <p><span>40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the
                            plague&nbsp;<em>is</em>, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the
                            city:</span></p>
                    <p><span>41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out
                            the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:</span></p>
                    <p><span>42 And they shall take other stones, and put&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;in the place of those
                            stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away
                            the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;</span></p>
                    <p><span>44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold,&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;the plague be
                            spread in the house, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a fretting leprosy in the house:
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;unclean.</span></p>
                    <p><span>45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the
                            morter of the house; and he shall carry&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;forth out of the city into
                            an unclean place.</span></p>
                    <p><span>46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean
                            until the even.</span></p>
                    <p><span>47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house
                            shall wash his clothes.</span></p>
                    <p><span>48 And if the priest shall come in, and look&nbsp;<em>upon</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>, and,
                            behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the
                            priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and
                            hyssop:</span></p>
                    <p><span>50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird,
                            and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the
                            house seven times:</span></p>
                    <p><span>52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water,
                            and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the
                            scarlet:</span></p>
                    <p><span>53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an
                            atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.</span></p>
                    <p><span>54 This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
                            scall,</span></p>
                    <p><span>55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,</span></p>
                    <p><span>56 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:</span></p>
                    <p><span>57 To teach when&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;unclean, and
                            when&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;clean: this&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the law of

                    <p><span>18 And he shall go out unto the altar that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;before the Lord, and make
                            an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the
                            goat, and put&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the horns of the altar round about.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it,
                            and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy&nbsp;<em>place</em>, and

                    <p><span>21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him
                            all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their
                            sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;away by

                    <p><span>22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he
                            shall let go the goat in the wilderness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the
                            linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy&nbsp;<em>place</em>, and shall

                    <p><span>24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and
                            come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an

                    <p><span>25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his

                    <p><span>27 And the bullock&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;the sin offering, and the
                            goat&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement

                            afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the
                            priest&rsquo;s office in his father&rsquo;s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put
                            on the linen clothes,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;the holy garments:</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement
                            for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement

                            them; This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the thing which the Lord&nbsp;hath commanded,

                    <p><span>AND the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be
                            holy: for I the Lord&nbsp;your God&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;holy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths:

                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods:

                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, ye shall offer
                            it at your own will.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until
                            the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;abominable; it shall

                    <p><span>8 Therefore&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;that eateth it shall bear his

                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the

                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.</span>

                            shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not go up and down&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;a talebearer among thy

                    <p><span>17&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke

                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy

                    <p><span>19&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a

                            mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a

                    <p><span>21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle
                            of the congregation,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;a ram for a trespass offering.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering
                            before the Lord&nbsp;for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be
                            forgiven him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23&nbsp;&nbsp;And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of
                            trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it
                            be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the

                    <p><span>25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the

                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall not eat&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;<em>thing</em>&nbsp;with the blood:
                            neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy
                            beard.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you:
                            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land
                            fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary:
                            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31&nbsp;&nbsp;Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be
                            defiled by them: I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;your God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man,
                            and fear thy God: I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33&nbsp;&nbsp;And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex
                            him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34&nbsp;<em>But</em>&nbsp;the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born
                            among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt:
                            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;your God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in
                            measure.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have:
                            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;your God, which brought you out of the land of
                            Egypt.</span></p>
                    <p><span>37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them:

                    <p><span>4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of

                    <p><span>22&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them:
                            that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for
                            they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to
                            possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the

                            manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as

                            them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 But for his kin, that is near unto him,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>, for his
                            mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his

                    <p><span>4&nbsp;<em>But</em>&nbsp;he shall not defile himself,&nbsp;<em>being</em>&nbsp;a chief man

                    <p><span>5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of

                    <p><span>6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the
                            offerings of the Lord&nbsp;made by fire,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the bread of their God, they
                            do offer: therefore they shall be holy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 They shall not take a wife&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a whore, or profane;
                            neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;holy

                    <p><span>8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy

                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore,
                            she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the high priest among his

                            the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his
                            mother;</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the

                            he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the Lord&nbsp;do sanctify

                            superfluous,</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed,

                    <p><span>22 He shall eat the bread of his God,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;of the most holy, and of the

                            accepted for you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>

                            made by fire unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And&nbsp;<em>whether</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;cow or ewe, ye shall

                    <p><span>29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord,
                            offer&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;at your own will.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow:

                            the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after

                    <p><span>12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the

                    <p><span>13 And the meat offering thereof&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;two tenth deals
                            of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the

                    <p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day
                            that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall

                    <p><span>17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be

                    <p><span>23&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>

                    <p><span>28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a day of

                    <p><span>31 Ye shall do no manner of

                    <p><span>32 It&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall

                    <p><span>6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for
                            thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in thy land, shall all
                            the increase thereof be meat.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven
                            years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine
                            years.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
                            tenth&nbsp;<em>day</em>&nbsp;of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the
                            trumpet sound throughout all your land.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
                            throughout&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
                            jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return
                            every man unto his family.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which
                            groweth of itself in it, nor gather&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>grapes</em>&nbsp;in it of thy
                            vine undressed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 For it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the
                            increase thereof out of the field.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest&nbsp;<em>ought</em>&nbsp;of thy
                            neighbour&rsquo;s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy
                            neighbour,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall
                            sell unto thee:</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according
                            to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it:
                            for&nbsp;<em>according</em>&nbsp;to the
                            number&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>years</em>&nbsp;of the fruits doth he
                            sell unto thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for
                            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;your God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye
                            shall dwell in the land in safety.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in
                            safety.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor
                            gather in our increase:</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth
                            fruit for three years.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat&nbsp;<em>yet</em>&nbsp;of old fruit until the
                            ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;the
                            old&nbsp;<em>store</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23&nbsp;&nbsp;The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;mine;
                            for ye&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strangers and sojourners with me.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>25&nbsp;&nbsp;If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of
                            his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his
                            brother sold.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man
                            to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 But if he be not able to restore&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;to him, then that which is sold
                            shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the
                            jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a
                            whole year after it is sold;&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;a full year may he redeem it.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house
                            that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that
                            bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as
                            the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the houses of the
                            cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his
                            possession, shall go out
                            in&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>year</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;jubile: for the houses of the
                            cities of the Levites&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;their possession among the children of
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;their perpetual possession.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35&nbsp;&nbsp;And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou
                            shalt relieve
                            him:&nbsp;<em>yea</em>,&nbsp;<em>though</em>&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a
                            stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with
                            thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for
                            increase.</span></p>
                    <p><span>38 I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;your God, which brought you forth out of the land
                            of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to be your God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>39&nbsp;&nbsp;And if thy brother&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>dwelleth</em>&nbsp;by thee be
                            waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
                            bondservant:</span></p>
                    <p><span>40&nbsp;<em>But</em>&nbsp;as an hired servant,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;as a sojourner, he
                            shall be with thee,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>41 And&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;shall he depart from thee,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;he and
                            his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his
                            fathers shall he return.</span></p>
                    <p><span>42 For they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of
                            Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.</span></p>
                    <p><span>43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt
                            have,&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;of the heathen that are round about you; of
                            them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.</span></p>
                    <p><span>45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye
                            buy, and of their families that&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;with you, which they begat in your
                            land: and they shall be your possession.</span></p>
                    <p><span>46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to
                            inherit&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;a possession; they shall be your bondmen
                            for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another
                            with rigour.</span></p>
                    <p><span>47&nbsp;&nbsp;And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
                            brother&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>dwelleth</em>&nbsp;by him wax poor, and sell himself
                            unto the stranger&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the
                            stranger&rsquo;s family:</span></p>
                    <p><span>48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem
                            him:</span></p>
                    <p><span>49 Either his uncle, or his uncle&rsquo;s son, may redeem him,
                            or&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if
                            he be able, he may redeem himself.</span></p>
                    <p><span>50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto
                            the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
                            according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>51 If&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;yet many years&nbsp;<em>behind</em>,
                            according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he
                            was bought for.</span></p>
                    <p><span>52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with
                            him,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;according unto his years shall he give him again the price of
                            his redemption.</span></p>
                    <p><span>53&nbsp;<em>And</em>&nbsp;as a yearly hired servant shall he be with
                            him:&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;shall not rule with rigour
                            over him in thy sight.</span></p>
                    <p><span>54 And if he be not redeemed in these&nbsp;<em>years</em>, then he shall go out in the year
                            of jubile,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;he, and his children with him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>55 For unto me the children of Israel&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;servants;
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt:
                            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;your God.</span></p>

                    <p><span>19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your
                            earth as brass:</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase,
                            neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21&nbsp;&nbsp;And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring
                            seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and
                            destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your&nbsp;<em>high</em>&nbsp;ways shall
                            be desolate.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto
                            me;</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your
                            sins.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
                            of&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I
                            will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the
                            enemy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;<em>And</em>&nbsp;when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake
                            your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;your bread again by
                            weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven
                            times for your sins.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye
                            eat.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases
                            upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I
                            will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be
                            astonished at it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your
                            land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and
                            ye&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;in your enemies&rsquo; land;&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;then shall the
                            land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths,
                            when ye dwelt upon it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 And upon them that are left&nbsp;<em>alive</em>&nbsp;of you I will send a faintness into
                            their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them;
                            and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and
                            ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span></p>
                    <p><span>38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you
                            up.</span></p>
                    <p><span>39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies&rsquo;
                            lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their
                            trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto
                            me;</span></p>
                    <p><span>41 And&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them
                            into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then
                            accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</span></p>
                    <p><span>42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also
                            my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</span></p>
                    <p><span>43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth
                            desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,
                            even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them
                            away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with
                            them: for I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;their God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought
                            forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God:
                            I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>46 These&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the statutes and judgments and laws, which the
                            Lord&nbsp;made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of
                            Moses.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular
                            vow, the persons&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;for the Lord&nbsp;by thy
                            estimation.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old,
                            even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the
                            sanctuary.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And if it&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
                            shekels.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And if&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;from five years old even unto twenty years
                            old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten
                            shekels.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And if&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;from a month old even unto five years old,
                            then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy
                            estimation&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;three shekels of silver.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And if&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;from sixty years old and above;
                            if&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen

                    <p><span>8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest,
                            and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value
                            him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And if&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto
                            the Lord, all that&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;<em>man</em>&nbsp;giveth of such unto the

                    <p><span>10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he
                            shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>11 And if&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;any unclean beast, of which they do not
                            offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest

                    <p><span>13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a

                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;And when a man shall sanctify his
                            house&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;holy unto the Lord, then the priest shall
                            estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it
                            stand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the
                            fifth&nbsp;<em>part</em>&nbsp;of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be
                            his.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;<em>part</em>&nbsp;of
                            a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an
                            homer of barley seed&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;<em>valued</em>&nbsp;at fifty
                            shekels of silver.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall
                            stand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the
                            money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be
                            abated from thy estimation.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the
                            fifth&nbsp;<em>part</em>&nbsp;of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be
                            assured to him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it
                            shall not be redeemed any more.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field
                            devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest&rsquo;s.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And if&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;<em>man</em>&nbsp;sanctify unto the Lord&nbsp;a field which
                            he hath bought, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;not of the fields of his possession;</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy
                            estimation,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine
                            estimation in that day,&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;a holy thing unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was
                            bought,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;to him to whom the possession of the
                            land&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;<em>belong</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs
                            shall be the shekel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord&rsquo;s firstling,
                            no man shall sanctify it; whether&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;ox, or sheep:
                            it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the Lord&rsquo;s.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And if&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;of an unclean beast, then he shall
                            redeem&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;according to thine estimation, and shall add a
                            fifth&nbsp;<em>part</em>&nbsp;of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold
                            according to thy estimation.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the Lord&nbsp;of all that
                            he hath,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall
                            be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;most holy unto the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
                            redeemed;&nbsp;<em>but</em>&nbsp;shall surely be put to death.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And all the tithe of the land,&nbsp;<em>whether</em>&nbsp;of the seed of the
                            land,&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;of the fruit of the tree,&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the
                            Lord&rsquo;s:&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;holy unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And if a man will at all redeem&nbsp;<em>ought</em>&nbsp;of his tithes, he shall add
                            thereto the fifth&nbsp;<em>part</em>&nbsp;thereof.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;of
                            whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he
                            change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be
                            redeemed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 These&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the commandments, which the Lord&nbsp;commanded Moses for
                            the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</span></p>
