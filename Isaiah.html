                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THE vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of
                        Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
                    </p>
                    <p>2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken, I have
                        nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>
                    <p>3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&rsquo;s
                        crib:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Israel doth not know, my people doth not
                        consider.</p>
                    <p>4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are
                        corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger,
                        they are gone away backward.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the
                        whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>
                    <p>6 From the sole of the foot even unto the
                        head<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        soundness in it;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wounds, and bruises, and
                        putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
                    </p>
                    <p>7 Your country<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>desolate, your
                        cities<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>burned with fire: your land, strangers
                        devour it in your presence,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>desolate, as
                        overthrown by strangers.</p>
                    <p>8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of
                        cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>
                    <p>9 Except the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should
                        have been as Sodom,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>we should have been like
                        unto Gomorrah.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law
                        of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p>
                    <p>11 To what purpose<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the multitude of your
                        sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed
                        beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</p>
                    <p>12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</p>
                    <p>13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths,
                        the calling of assemblies, I cannot away
                        with;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>iniquity,
                        even the solemn meeting.</p>
                    <p>14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am
                        weary to bear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many
                        prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before
                        mine eyes; cease to do evil;</p>
                    <p>17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the
                        widow.</p>
                    <p>18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they
                        shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
                    <p>19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</p>
                    <p>20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment;
                        righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</p>
                    <p>22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</p>
                    <p>23 Thy princes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rebellious, and companions of
                        thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless,
                        neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</p>
                    <p>24 Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I
                        will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</p>
                    <p>25<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross,
                        and take away all thy tin:</p>
                    <p>26 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning:
                        afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</p>
                    <p>27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the
                        sinners<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>together,
                        and they that forsake the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be consumed.</p>
                    <p>29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for
                        the gardens that ye have chosen.</p>
                    <p>30 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</p>
                    <p>31 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn
                        together, and none shall quench<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>

                    <p>THE word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>2 And it shall come to pass in the last
                        days,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the mountain of the Lord&rsquo;s house

                    <p>3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the
                        house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for

                    <p>4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their

                        their carcases<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>torn in the midst of the
                        streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his
                        hand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>stretched out still.</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss
                        unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:</p>
                    <p>27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the
                        girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</p>
                    <p>28 Whose arrows<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sharp, and all their bows bent,
                        their horses&rsquo; hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:</p>
                    <p>29 Their
                        roaring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like a
                        lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and
                        shall carry<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away safe, and none shall
                        deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>30 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>look unto the land, behold
                        darkness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sorrow, and the light is darkened in
                        the heavens thereof.</p>

                    <p>IN the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up,
                        and his train filled the temple.</p>
                    <p>2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with
                        twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>
                    <p>3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy,
                        holy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts: the
                        whole earth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>full of his glory.</p>
                    <p>4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with
                        smoke.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Woe<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>me!
                        for I am undone; because I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a man of unclean
                        lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King,
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                    <p>6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his
                        hand,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he had taken with the tongs from off
                        the altar:</p>
                    <p>7 And he laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this
                        hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</p>
                    <p>8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then
                        said I, Here<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I; send me.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand
                        not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</p>
                    <p>10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they
                        see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and
                        be healed.</p>
                    <p>11 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant,
                        and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</p>
                    <p>12 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>have removed men far away,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great

                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But yet in

                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil
                        tree, and as an oak, whose substance<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in them,
                        when they

                    <p>AND it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of
                        Judah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the
                        son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not
                        prevail against it.</p>
                    <p>2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart
                        was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</p>
                    <p>3 Then said the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and
                        Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
                        fuller&rsquo;s field;</p>
                    <p>4 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails
                        of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
                        Remaliah.</p>
                    <p>5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
                    </p>
                    <p>6 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king
                        in the midst of it,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son of Tabeal:</p>
                    <p>7 Thus saith the Lord God, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</p>
                    <p>8 For the head of Syria<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Damascus, and the head of
                        Damascus<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Rezin; and within threescore and five
                        years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</p>
                    <p>9 And the head of Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Samaria, and the head
                        of Samaria<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Remaliah&rsquo;s son. If ye will not
                        believe, surely ye shall not be established.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Moreover the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake again unto Ahaz, saying,</p>
                    <p>11 Ask thee a sign of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the
                        height above.</p>
                    <p>12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.</p>
                    <p>13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of
                        David;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a small

                    <p>14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a
                        son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</p>
                    <p>15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</p>
                    <p>16 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou
                        abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people,
                        and upon thy father&rsquo;s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed
                        from Judah;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king of Assyria.</p>
                    <p>18 And it shall come to pass in that day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall hiss for the fly
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the uttermost part of the rivers of
                        Egypt, and for the bee that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of
                        Assyria.</p>
                    <p>19 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of
                        the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</p>
                    <p>20 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is
                        hired,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>namely</em>, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the
                        head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</p>
                    <p>21 And it shall come to pass in that day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a man
                        shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;</p>
                    <p>22 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of
                        milk<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they shall give he shall eat butter: for
                        butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</p>
                    <p>23 And it shall come to pass in that day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>every

                        shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be for briers and thorns.</p>

                        because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</p>
                    <p>25 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>on</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all hills that shall be digged with the
                        mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the
                        sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>11 Therefore the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and

                    <p>14 Therefore the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush,

                    <p>15 The ancient and honourable, he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the head; and

                        hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned

                    <p>4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the
                        earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips
                        shall he slay the wicked.</p>
                    <p>5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

                    <p>6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the

                        an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.</p>
                    <p>11 And it shall come to pass in that day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                    <p>12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and
                        gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</p>
                    <p>13 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim
                        shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.</p>
                    <p>14 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil
                        them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of
                        Ammon shall obey them.</p>
                    <p>15 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with
                        his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams,
                        and make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>go over dryshod.</p>
                    <p>16 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from
                        Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>

                    <p>THE burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
                        waste,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brought to silence; because in the night

                    <p>5 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.</p>
                    <p>6 And they shall turn the rivers far away;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.</p>
                    <p>7 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks,
                        shall wither, be driven away, and be no<span>&nbsp;</span><em>more</em>.</p>
                    <p>8 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and
                        they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.</p>
                    <p>9 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.</p>
                    <p>10 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make
                        sluices<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ponds for fish.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Surely the princes of

                        know what the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.</p>
                    <p>13 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced
                        Egypt,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                    <p>14 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have
                        caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a
                        drunken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>staggereth in his vomit.</p>
                    <p>15 Neither shall there be<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>work for Egypt, which
                        the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.</p>
                    <p>16 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the
                        shaking of the hand of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, which he shaketh over it.</p>
                    <p>17 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof
                        shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, which
                        he hath determined against it.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language
                        of Canaan, and swear to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; one shall be called, The city of
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>19 In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst of the land of
                        Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord.</p>
                    <p>20 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts in the
                        land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>because of the oppressors, and
                        he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.</p>
                    <p>21 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a

                    <p>22 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and

                        Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve
                        with the Assyrians.</p>

                        against Ashdod, and took it;</p>
                    <p>2 At the same time spake the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and
                        loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so,
                        walking naked and barefoot.</p>
                    <p>3 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot

                    <p>10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the

                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of

                    <p>12 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye:

                    <p>THE burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house,
                        no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</p>
                    <p>2 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea,
                        have replenished.</p>
                    <p>3 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the

                        men,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nor</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bring up virgins.</p>

                    <p>8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning<span>&nbsp;</span><em>city</em>, whose

                    <p>9 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all

                        honourable of the earth.</p>
                    <p>10 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of

                    <p>11 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath

                        many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit

                        laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently,

                    <p>8 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; the desire
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>our</em><span>&nbsp;</span>soul<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</p>
                    <p>9 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee
                        early: for when thy judgments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the earth, the
                        inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</p>
                    <p>10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will he
                        not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold
                        the majesty of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>11 Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy hand is lifted up, they will not
                        see:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they shall see, and be ashamed
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>envy at the people; yea, the fire of
                        thine enemies shall devour them.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all
                        our works in us.</p>

                        they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory
                        to perish.</p>
                    <p>15 Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified:
                        thou hadst
                        removed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>far<span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all

                        time of her delivery, is in pain,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>crieth out in
                        her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O Lord.</p>
                    <p>18 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have
                        not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p>
                    <p>19 Thy dead<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall
                        live,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>together</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy
                        dew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the dew of
                        herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors
                        about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p>
                    <p>21 For, behold, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of
                        the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover
                        her slain.</p>

                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a

                    <p>17 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall
                        sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement

                        trodden down by it.</p>
                    <p>19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass

                    <p>21 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall rise up
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mount Perazim, he shall be wroth
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his
                        work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</p>
                    <p>22 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the
                        Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.</p>
                    <p>23<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.</p>
                    <p>24 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?</p>
                    <p>25 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the
                        cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?</p>
                    <p>26 For his God doth instruct him to
                        discretion,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>doth teach him.</p>
                    <p>27 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned
                        about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.

                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw

                        honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the

                        the wisdom of their wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall perish, and the
                        understanding of their prudent<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall be hid.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the
                        dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?</p>
                    <p>16 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter&rsquo;s clay: for
                        shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him
                        that framed it, He had no understanding?</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon
                        shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the
                        eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.</p>
                    <p>19 The meek also shall increase<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>joy in the

                    <p>21 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate,
                        and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.</p>
                    <p>22 Therefore thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob
                        shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</p>
                    <p>23 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall
                        sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</p>
                    <p>24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn

                    <p>13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high

                        because<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>many;
                        and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel,
                        neither seek the Lord!</p>
                    <p>2 Yet he also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wise, and will bring evil, and will
                        not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help
                        of them that work iniquity.</p>
                    <p>3 Now the Egyptians<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men, and not God; and their
                        horses flesh, and not spirit. When the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall stretch out his hand, both
                        he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail
                        together.</p>
                    <p>4 For thus hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion
                        roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will not be afraid of their voice, nor
                        abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts come down to
                        fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.</p>
                    <p>5 As birds flying, so will the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also
                        he will
                        deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it;</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>passing
                        over he will preserve<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Turn ye
                        unto<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whom the
                        children of Israel have deeply revolted.</p>
                    <p>7 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which
                        your own hands have made unto you<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a sin.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and
                        the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young
                        men shall be discomfited.</p>
                    <p>9 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the
                        ensign, saith the Lord, whose fire<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Zion, and
                        his furnace in Jerusalem.</p>

                    <p>2 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers

                    <p>4 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall

                    </p>
                    <p>6 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise
                        hypocrisy, and to utter error against the Lord, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he
                        will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</p>
                    <p>7 The instruments also of the churl<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>evil: he

                    <p>14 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and

                    <p>23 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the

                        place of rest.</p>
                    <p>15 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow:
                        there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and read: no one of these shall
                        fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered
                        them.</p>
                    <p>17 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall
                        possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</p>

                    <p>NOW it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king
                        Hezekiah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Sennacherib king of Assyria came up
                        against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.</p>
                    <p>2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a
                        great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller&rsquo;s
                        field.</p>
                    <p>3 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah&rsquo;s son, which was over the house, and Shebna the
                        scribe, and Joah, Asaph&rsquo;s son, the recorder.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the
                        great king, the king of Assyria, What
                        confidence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this wherein thou trustest?</p>
                    <p>5 I say,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>sayest</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em>,
                        (but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vain
                        words)<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span>counsel
                        and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</p>
                    <p>6 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go
                        into his hand, and pierce it: so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh king of
                        Egypt to all that trust in him.</p>
                    <p>7 But if thou say to me, We trust in the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our
                        God:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not he, whose
                        high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye
                        shall worship before this altar?</p>
                    <p>8 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee
                        two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</p>
                    <p>9 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master&rsquo;s
                        servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</p>
                    <p>10 And am I now come up without the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>against this land to destroy it? the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray
                        thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
                        understand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and speak not to us in the
                        Jews&rsquo; language, in the ears of the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the wall.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee
                        to speak these
                        words?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>sent</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with
                        you?</p>
                    <p>13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews&rsquo; language, and said, Hear
                        ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</p>
                    <p>14 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will
                        surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
                    <p>16 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
                        Make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>an</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>agreement</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a present, and come out to me: and eat ye
                        every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
                        own cistern;</p>
                    <p>17 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land
                        of bread and vineyards.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Beware</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land
                        out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
                    <p>19 Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the gods of Hamath and Arphad?
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they
                        delivered Samaria out of my hand?</p>
                    <p>20 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among all
                        the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</p>
                    <p>21 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king&rsquo;s commandment was,
                        saying, Answer him not.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
                        and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>clothes rent, and told him the words of

                    <p>AND it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, that he rent his
                        clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>2 And he sent Eliakim, who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over the household,
                        and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the
                        prophet the son of Amoz.</p>
                    <p>3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This

                        blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth,

                        strength to bring forth.</p>
                    <p>4 It may be the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of
                        Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath heard: wherefore lift
                        up<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prayer for the remnant that is left.</p>
                    <p>5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus
                        saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the
                        king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</p>
                    <p>7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land;
                        and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
                        Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</p>
                    <p>9 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee.
                        And when he heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</p>
                    <p>10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest,
                        deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
                    <p>11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them
                        utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</p>
                    <p>12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
                        destroyed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
                        children of Eden which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Telassar?</p>
                    <p>13 Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king of Hamath, and the king of

                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and
                        read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord.</p>
                    <p>15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord, saying,</p>
                    <p>16 O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, God of Israel, that
                        dwellest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>between</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the cherubims,
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                        earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</p>
                    <p>17 Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord, and see: and hear all the words
                        of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.</p>
                    <p>18 Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
                    </p>
                    <p>19 And have cast their gods into the fire: for
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no gods, but the work of men&rsquo;s
                        hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</p>
                    <p>20 Now therefore, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms
                        of the earth may know that thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of
                        Assyria:</p>
                    <p>22 This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the word which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath
                        despised thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>laughed thee to scorn; the
                        daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</p>
                    <p>23 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou
                        exalted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>voice, and lifted up thine eyes on
                        high?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
                    <p>24 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots
                        am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the
                        tall cedars thereof,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the choice fir trees
                        thereof: and I will enter into the height of his
                        border,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the forest of his Carmel.</p>
                    <p>25 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of
                        the besieged places.</p>
                    <p>26 Hast thou not heard long ago,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have done
                        it;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of ancient times, that I have formed it?
                        now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced
                        cities<span>&nbsp;</span><em>into</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ruinous heaps.</p>
                    <p>27 Therefore their inhabitants<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of small power,
                        they were dismayed and confounded: they were<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        grass of the field, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the green
                        herb,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the grass on the housetops,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>corn</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blasted
                        before it be grown up.</p>
                    <p>28 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</p>
                    <p>29 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put
                        my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which
                        thou camest.</p>
                    <p>30 And this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        sign unto thee, Ye shall eat<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>year such as
                        groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year
                        sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</p>
                    <p>31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear
                        fruit upward:</p>
                    <p>32 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the
                        zeal of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts shall do this.</p>
                    <p>33 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not
                        come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank
                        against it.</p>
                    <p>34 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith
                        the Lord.</p>
                    <p>35 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David&rsquo;s
                        sake.</p>
                    <p>36 Then the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>went forth, and smote in the camp of the
                        Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning,
                        behold, they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all dead corpses.</p>
                    <p>37<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and
                        dwelt at Nineveh.</p>
                    <p>38 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech
                        and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and
                        Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.</p>

                    <p>IN those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him,
                        and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not
                        live.</p>
                    <p>2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the Lord,</p>
                    <p>3 And said, Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with
                        a perfect heart, and have
                        done<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good
                        in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to Isaiah, saying,</p>
                    <p>5 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
                        prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</p>
                    <p>6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend
                        this city.</p>
                    <p>7 And this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        sign unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will do this thing that he hath
                        spoken;</p>
                    <p>8 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of
                        Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.

                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was
                        recovered of his sickness:</p>
                    <p>10 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of
                        the residue of my years.</p>
                    <p>11 I said, I shall not see the Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord,
                        in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</p>
                    <p>12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd&rsquo;s tent: I have cut off like a
                        weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from
                        day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to night wilt thou make an end of me.</p>
                    <p>13 I reckoned till morning,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em>, as a lion, so will he break all my
                        bones: from day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to night wilt thou make an end
                        of me.</p>
                    <p>14 Like a crane<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a swallow, so did I chatter: I
                        did mourn as a dove: mine eyes
                        fail<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>looking</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upward:
                        O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</p>
                    <p>15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath
                        done<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I shall go softly all my years in the
                        bitterness of my soul.</p>
                    <p>16 O Lord, by
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>live,
                        and in all

                        of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</p>
                    <p>17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my
                        soul<span>&nbsp;</span><em>delivered</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from
                        the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</p>
                    <p>18 For the grave cannot praise thee, death
                        can<span>&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span>&nbsp;</span>celebrate thee: they that go down into the
                        pit cannot hope for thy truth.</p>
                    <p>19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day: the father to the children shall
                        make known thy truth.</p>
                    <p>20 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ready</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in
                        the house of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and
                        lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall
                        recover.</p>
                    <p>22 Hezekiah also had said, What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the sign that I

                    <p>AT that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to
                        Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.</p>
                    <p>2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver,
                        and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and
                        all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion,

                        a far country unto me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from Babylon.</p>
                    <p>4 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in mine house have they seen: there is
                        nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.</p>
                    <p>5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts:</p>

                    <p>23 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.</p>
                    <p>24 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take
                        root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind
                        shall take them away as stubble.</p>
                    <p>25 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.</p>

                        villages<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Kedar doth inhabit: let the
                        inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</p>
                    <p>12 Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the islands.</p>
                    <p>13 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a
                        man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.</p>
                    <p>14 I have long time holden my peace; I have been
                        still,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>refrained
                        myself:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>now</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will I cry like a travailing woman; I
                        will destroy and devour at once.</p>
                    <p>15 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers
                        islands, and I will dry up the pools.</p>
                    <p>16 And I will bring the blind by a way<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they
                        knew not; I will lead them in paths<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they have
                        not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things
                        will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust
                        in graven images, that say to the molten images,
                        Ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our gods.</p>
                    <p>18 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</p>
                    <p>19 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my
                        messenger<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I sent?
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blind

                        and blind as the Lord&rsquo;s servant?</p>
                    <p>20 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.</p>
                    <p>21 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>is well pleased for his righteousness&rsquo; sake; he will magnify
                        the law, and make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>honourable.</p>
                    <p>22 But this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a people robbed and
                        spoiled;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all of
                        them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none
                        delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</p>
                    <p>23 Who among you will give ear to this?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>who</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will
                        hearken and hear for the time to come?</p>
                    <p>24 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the Lord, he against whom we
                        have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</p>
                    <p>25 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it
                        hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he
                        laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not to heart.</p>

                    <p>BUT now thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed
                        thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have
                        called<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by thy name;
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine.</p>
                    <p>2 When thou passest through the waters,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee; and

                        not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p>
                    <p>3 For I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, the
                        Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave

                        seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</p>
                    <p>6 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and

                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your
                        sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose
                        cry<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the ships.</p>

                    <p>16 Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</p>
                    <p>17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down
                        together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
                    </p>
                    <p>19 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even
                        make a way in the wilderness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rivers in the
                        desert.</p>
                    <p>20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the
                        wilderness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rivers in the desert, to give drink
                        to my people, my chosen.</p>
                    <p>21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of
                        me, O Israel.</p>
                    <p>23 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured
                        me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with
                        incense.</p>
                    <p>24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy
                        sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine
                        iniquities.</p>
                    <p>25
                        I,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he
                        that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</p>
                    <p>26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.</p>
                    <p>27 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</p>
                    <p>28 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and
                        Israel to reproaches.</p>

                    <p>22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return
                        unto me; for I have redeemed thee.</p>

                    <p>24 Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that maketh

                        to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two

                    <p>12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it:

                    <p>16 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion

                    <p>COME down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the
                        ground:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.</p>
                    <p>2 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh,
                        pass over the rivers.</p>
                    <p>3 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I

                        man.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our redeemer,
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name,
                        the Holy One of Israel.</p>
                    <p>5 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no
                        more be called, The lady of kingdoms.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given
                        them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily
                        laid thy yoke.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for
                        ever:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that thou didst not lay
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to thy heart, neither didst remember
                        the latter end of it.</p>
                    <p>8 Therefore hear now
                        this,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>given
                        to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em>, and none else beside me; I shall not
                        sit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a widow, neither shall I know the loss of
                        children:</p>
                    <p>9 But these two<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall come to thee in a
                        moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their
                        perfection for the multitude of thy
                        sorceries,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for the great abundance of thine
                        enchantments.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth
                        me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em>, and none else beside me.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence
                        it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and
                        desolation shall come upon thee
                        suddenly,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt not know.</p>
                    <p>12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast
                        laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers,
                        the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee
                        from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>these</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        shall come upon thee.</p>
                    <p>14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves
                        from the power of the
                        flame:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        coal to warm at,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nor</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fire to sit before it.</p>
                    <p>15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast
                        laboured,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy merchants, from thy youth: they
                        shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.</p>

                    <p>HEAR ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of
                        the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of
                        Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not in truth, nor in righteousness.</p>
                    <p>2 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name.</p>
                    <p>3 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and
                        I shewed them; I did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>suddenly, and they came
                        to pass.</p>
                    <p>4 Because I knew that thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>obstinate, and thy

                    <p>6 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye

                    <p>7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them
                        not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</p>
                    <p>8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
                        time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine ear was not opened: for I knew that

                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For my name&rsquo;s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
                        will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.</p>
                    <p>10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of
                        affliction.</p>
                    <p>11 For mine own sake,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for mine own sake, will I

                        have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from
                        the beginning; from the time that it was,
                        there<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I: and now the Lord God, and his Spirit,
                        hath sent me.</p>
                    <p>17 Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God which
                        teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the

                    <p>18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy
                        righteousness as the waves of the sea:</p>
                    <p>19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof;

                        the waters gushed out.</p>

                    <p>LISTEN, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath
                        called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.</p>
                    <p>2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and

                    <p>6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of

                    <p>12 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these

                    <p>19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too
                        narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.</p>
                    <p>20 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine
                        ears, The place<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>too strait for me: give place to
                        me that I may dwell.</p>
                    <p>21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my
                        children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these?
                        Behold, I was left alone; these,
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>been?</em></p>
                    <p>22 Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my
                        standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>arms, and thy daughters shall be carried
                        upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shoulders.</p>
                    <p>23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow
                        down to thee with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>face toward the earth, and
                        lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that
                        wait for me.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
                        delivered?</p>
                    <p>25 But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of
                        the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I
                        will save thy children.</p>
                    <p>26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with
                        their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty
                        One of Jacob.</p>

                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no

                        clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>12 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will go
                        before you; and the God of
                        Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your

                        extolled, and be very high.</p>
                    <p>14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more
                        than the sons of men:</p>

                    <p>2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath
                        no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no beauty
                        that we should desire him.</p>
                    <p>3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as
                        it were<span>&nbsp;</span><em>our</em><span>&nbsp;</span>faces from him; he was despised, and we
                        esteemed him not.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
                        esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>
                    <p>5 But he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wounded for our
                        transgressions,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bruised
                        for our iniquities: the chastisement of our
                        peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon him; and with his stripes we are
                        healed.</p>
                    <p>6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>
                    <p>7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to
                        the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p>
                    <p>8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was
                        cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</p>
                    <p>9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no
                        violence,
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>deceit
                        in his mouth.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet it pleased the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to bruise him; he hath
                        put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an
                        offering for sin, he shall see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>seed, he shall
                        prolong<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days, and the pleasure of the

                    <p>11 He shall see of the travail of his
                        soul,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall be satisfied: by his knowledge
                        shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>
                    <p>12 Therefore will I divide

                        death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
                        intercession for the transgressors.</p>

                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none; for
                        salvation,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it is far off from us.</p>
                    <p>12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our
                        transgressions<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with us;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our
                        iniquities, we know them;</p>
                    <p>13 In transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God, speaking
                        oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p>
                    <p>14 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in
                        the street, and equity cannot enter.</p>
                    <p>15 Yea, truth faileth; and he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>departeth from
                        evil maketh himself a prey: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saw<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>,
                        and it displeased him
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        judgment.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And he saw
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no man,
                        and wondered
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained
                        him.</p>
                    <p>17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he
                        put on the garments of vengeance<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>clothing, and
                        was clad with zeal as a cloke.</p>
                    <p>18 According to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>deeds, accordingly he will
                        repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay
                        recompence.</p>
                    <p>19 So shall they fear the name of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>from the west, and his glory from
                        the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall lift up a standard against him.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from
                        transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>21 As for me, this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my covenant with them, saith
                        the Lord; My spirit that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon thee, and my words
                        which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy

                    <p>WHO<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this that cometh from Edom, with dyed
                        garments from Bozrah?
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glorious in
                        his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty
                        to save.</p>
                    <p>2 Wherefore<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span>red
                        in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?</p>
                    <p>3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                        with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall
                        be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</p>
                    <p>4 For the day of vengeance<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in mine heart, and the
                        year of my redeemed is come.</p>
                    <p>5 And I looked,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none to
                        help; and I wondered
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none to
                        uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</p>
                    <p>6 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will
                        bring down their strength to the earth.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the praises of the Lord, according to all
                        that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of
                        Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude
                        of his lovingkindnesses.</p>
                    <p>8 For he said, Surely they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my people,
                        children<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will not lie: so he was their
                        Saviour.</p>
                    <p>9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love
                        and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned
                        to be their enemy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he fought against them.</p>
                    <p>11 Then he remembered the days of old,
                        Moses,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                        people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>,
                        Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that brought them up out of the sea
                        with the shepherd of his flock? where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that
                        put his holy Spirit within him?</p>
                    <p>12 That led<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the right hand of Moses with his
                        glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</p>
                    <p>13 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the
                        wilderness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they should not stumble?</p>
                    <p>14 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>caused him to
                        rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness
                        and of thy glory: where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy zeal and thy
                        strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?</p>
                    <p>16 Doubtless thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our father, though Abraham be
                        ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our father, our redeemer; thy
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from everlasting.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy
                        ways,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hardened our heart from thy fear? Return
                        for thy servants&rsquo; sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.</p>
                    <p>18 The people of thy holiness have possessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but
                        a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</p>
                    <p>19 We are<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thine:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou never barest rule over them;
                        they were not called by thy name.</p>

                        These<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth

                    <p>7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, which have burned
                        incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their

                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>saith, Destroy it not; for a

                    <p>9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and
                        mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</p>
                    <p>10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie
                        down in, for my people that have sought me.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they that
                        forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that
                        furnish the drink offering unto that number.</p>
                    <p>12 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because
                        when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes,
                        and did choose<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wherein I delighted not.</p>
                    <p>13 Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry:
                        behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but
                        ye shall be ashamed:</p>
                    <p>14 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and
                        shall howl for vexation of spirit.</p>
                    <p>15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span>shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:</p>
                    <p>16 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that
                        sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are
                        forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former
                        shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>
                    <p>18 But be ye glad and rejoice for
                        ever<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which I
                        create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</p>
                    <p>19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no
                        more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</p>
                    <p>20 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days:
                        for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the

                        accursed.</p>
                    <p>21 And they shall build houses, and
                        inhabit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and they shall plant vineyards, and
                        eat the fruit of them.</p>
                    <p>22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the
                        days of a tree<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the days of my people, and mine
                        elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</p>
                    <p>23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and
                        their offspring with them.</p>
                    <p>24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet
                        speaking, I will hear.</p>
                    <p>25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and
                        dust<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        serpent&rsquo;s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.

                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the place of my rest?</p>
                    <p>2 For all those<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hath mine hand made, and all
                        those<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>have been, saith the Lord: but to
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will I
                        look,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>poor
                        and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.</p>
                    <p>3 He that killeth an
                        ox<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he
                        slew a man; he that sacrificeth a
                        lamb,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he cut off a
                        dog&rsquo;s neck; he that offereth an
                        oblation,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>offered</em><span>&nbsp;</span>swine&rsquo;s
                        blood; he that burneth
                        incense,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he
                        blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their
                        abominations.</p>
                    <p>4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I
                        called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes,
                        and chose<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in which I delighted not.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren
                        that hated you, that cast you out for my name&rsquo;s sake, said, Let the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
                    </p>
                    <p>6 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that rendereth recompence to his enemies.</p>
                    <p>7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man
                        child.</p>
                    <p>8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth
                        in one day?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall a nation be born at once? for
                        as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</p>
                    <p>9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord: shall I cause to
                        bring forth, and
                        shut<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>womb?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>saith thy
                        God.</p>
                    <p>10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with
                        her, all ye that mourn for her:</p>
                    <p>11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out,
                        and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</p>
                    <p>12 For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the
                        Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne
                        upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sides, and be dandled
                        upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>knees.</p>
                    <p>13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in
                        Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>14 And when ye see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em>, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
                        shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be known toward
                        his servants, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>indignation toward his
                        enemies.</p>
                    <p>15 For, behold, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will come with fire, and with his chariots like a
                        whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</p>
                    <p>16 For by fire and by his sword will the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>plead with all flesh: and the
                        slain of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be many.</p>
                    <p>17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>tree</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst, eating swine&rsquo;s flesh,
                        and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>18 For I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>know</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their works and their thoughts: it
                        shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
                    </p>
                    <p>19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the
                        nations,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the
                        bow,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Tubal, and
                        Javan,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the isles afar off, that have not heard
                        my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</p>
                    <p>20 And they shall bring all your brethren<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                        offering unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in
                        litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord,
                        as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>21 And I will also take of them for priests<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for
                        Levites, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the
                        Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain.</p>
                    <p>23 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from one new moon
                        to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith
                        the Lord.</p>
                    <p>24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against
                        me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an
                        abhorring unto all flesh.</p>
