for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</span></p><p><span>4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</span></p><p><span>5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die:in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</span></p><p><span>6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</span></p><p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</span></p><p><span>8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father&rsquo;s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</span></p><p><span>9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</span></p><p><span>10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</span></p><p><span>11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;beyond Jordan.</span></p><p><span>12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</span></p><p><span>13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</span></p><p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</span></p><p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Joseph&rsquo;s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</span></p><p><span>16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</span></p><p><span>17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</span></p><p><span>18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;thy servants.</span></p><p><span>19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;I in the place of God?</span></p><p><span>20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me;&nbsp;<em>but</em>&nbsp;God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;this day, to save much people alive.</span></p><p><span>21 Now therefore fear ye not:I will nourish you, and your little ones.
