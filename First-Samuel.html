                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of
                        Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</p>
                    <p>2 And he had two wives; the name of the
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah:
                        and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
                    <p>3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the
                        priests of the Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
                        Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p>
                    <p>5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had shut up her womb.</p>
                    <p>6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had shut up her womb.</p>
                    <p>7 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he did so year by year, when she went up to
                        the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</p>
                    <p>8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and
                        why is thy heart grieved?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not I better to thee
                        than ten sons?</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and
                        after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>10 And she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in bitterness of soul, and prayed
                        unto the Lord, and wept sore.</p>
                    <p>11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on
                        the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give
                        unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>all the
                        days of his life, and there shall no rasor come upon his head.</p>
                    <p>12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth.</p>
                    <p>13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard:
                        therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</p>
                    <p>14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</p>
                    <p>15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my
                        soul before the Lord.</p>
                    <p>16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint
                        and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p>
                    <p>17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
                        grant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy petition that thou hast asked of
                        him.</p>
                    <p>18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did
                        eat, and her countenance was no more<span>&nbsp;</span><em>sad</em>.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped
                        before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his
                        wife; and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>remembered her.</p>
                    <p>20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she
                        bare a son, and called his name Samuel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Because I have asked
                        him of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p>
                    <p>22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her
                        husband,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>go</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>up</em><span>&nbsp;</span>until
                        the child be weaned, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will bring him,
                        that he may appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever.</p>
                    <p>23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned
                        him; only the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son
                        suck until she weaned him.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her,
                        with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the
                        house of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in Shiloh: and the
                        child<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>young.</p>
                    <p>25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</p>
                    <p>26 And she said, Oh my lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy soul liveth, my
                        lord, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the woman that stood by thee here,
                        praying unto the Lord.</p>
                    <p>27 For this child I prayed; and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given me my petition which I
                        asked of him:</p>
                    <p>28 Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.
                        And he worshipped the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>there.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my
                        mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none holy as
                        the Lord:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none beside
                        thee:
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>any
                        rock like our God.</p>
                    <p>3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly;
                        let<span>&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span>&nbsp;</span>arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a God of knowledge, and by him actions are
                        weighed.</p>
                    <p>4 The bows of the mighty men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>broken, and they
                        that stumbled are girded with strength.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><em>They</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>full
                        have hired out themselves for bread;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hungry
                        ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</p>
                    <p>6 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and
                        bringeth up.</p>
                    <p>7 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p>
                    <p>8 He raiseth up the poor out of the
                        dust,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill,
                        to set<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among princes, and to make them inherit
                        the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
                        earth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord&rsquo;s, and he hath set the
                        world upon them.</p>
                    <p>9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by
                        strength shall no man prevail.</p>
                    <p>10 The adversaries of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall
                        he thunder upon them: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall
                        give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p>
                    <p>11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>before Eli the priest.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now the sons of
                        Eli<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 And the priests&rsquo; custom with the
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em>, when any man offered
                        sacrifice, the priest&rsquo;s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of
                        three teeth in his hand;</p>
                    <p>14 And he struck<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into the pan, or kettle, or
                        caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in
                        Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</p>
                    <p>15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest&rsquo;s servant came, and said to the man that
                        sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but
                        raw.</p>
                    <p>16 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>any man said unto him, Let them not fail
                        to burn the fat presently,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>much</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        thy soul desireth; then he would answer
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Nay;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but thou shalt
                        give<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>now: and if
                        not, I will take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by force.</p>
                    <p>17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord: for men abhorred the
                        offering of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But Samuel ministered before the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a child, girded with a linen ephod.</p>
                    <p>19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and
                        brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to him from year to year, when she came
                        up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord. And
                        they went unto their own home.</p>
                    <p>21 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and
                        two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did
                        unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that
                        assembled<span>&nbsp;</span><em>at</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the door of the tabernacle of the
                        congregation.</p>
                    <p>23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this
                        people.</p>
                    <p>24 Nay, my sons;
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no good report
                        that I hear: ye make the Lord&rsquo;s people to transgress.</p>
                    <p>25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord,
                        who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father,
                        because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>would slay them.</p>
                    <p>26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men.</p>
                    <p>27<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him,
                        Thus saith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt
                        in Pharaoh&rsquo;s house?</p>
                    <p>28 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of
                        Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my priest,
                        to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the
                        house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</p>
                    <p>29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have
                        commanded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>habitation;
                        and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings
                        of Israel my people?</p>
                    <p>30 Wherefore the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel saith, I said
                        indeed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy house, and the house of thy father,
                        should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saith, Be it far from me; for
                        them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</p>
                    <p>31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father&rsquo;s house,
                        that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</p>
                    <p>32 And thou shalt see an
                        enemy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>habitation,
                        in
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>wealth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>God</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall
                        give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</p>
                    <p>33 And the man of thine,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>whom</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I shall not cut off
                        from mine
                        altar,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in
                        the flower of their age.</p>
                    <p>34 And this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall
                        die both of them.</p>
                    <p>35 And I will raise me up a faithful
                        priest,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall do according
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
                        anointed for ever.</p>
                    <p>36 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>every one that is
                        left in thine house shall come<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>crouch to him
                        for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the
                        priests&rsquo; offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</p>

                    <p>AND the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>before Eli. And the word of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was precious in those
                        days;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no open
                        vision.</p>
                    <p>2 And it came to pass at that time, when
                        Eli<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>laid down in his place, and his eyes began
                        to wax dim,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he could not see;</p>
                    <p>3 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>, and Samuel was laid
                        down<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>sleep;</em></p>
                    <p>4 That the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>called Samuel: and he answered,
                        Here<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I.</p>
                    <p>5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I; for thou
                        calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>
                    <p>6 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and
                        said, Here<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I; for thou didst call me. And he
                        answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</p>
                    <p>7 Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>yet
                        revealed unto him.</p>
                    <p>8 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to
                        Eli, and said, Here<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I; for thou didst call me.
                        And Eli perceived that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had called the child.</p>
                    <p>9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt
                        say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
                    <p>10 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.
                        Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said to Samuel, Behold, I
                        will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</p>
                    <p>12 In that day I will perform against Eli
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which I have spoken concerning his
                        house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</p>
                    <p>13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth;
                        because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</p>
                    <p>14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli&rsquo;s house shall
                        not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of
                        the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</p>
                    <p>16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered,
                        Here<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I.</p>
                    <p>17 And he said, What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the thing
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Lord</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hath said
                        unto thee? I pray thee hide<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not from me: God do
                        so to thee, and more also, if thou hide<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thing
                        from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</p>
                    <p>18 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said,
                        It<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.
                    </p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel grew, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was with
                        him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</p>
                    <p>20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that
                        Samuel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>established<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        prophet of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>21 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>appeared again in Shiloh: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle,
                        and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</p>
                    <p>2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel
                        was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand
                        men.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
                        Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>smitten us to day before the Philistines?
                        Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>out of Shiloh unto us, that,
                        when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</p>
                    <p>4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, which
                        dwelleth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>between</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the cherubims: and the two sons of
                        Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there with the ark
                        of the covenant of God.</p>
                    <p>5 And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came into the camp, all Israel
                        shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</p>
                    <p>6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>meaneth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the noise of this great shout in the
                        camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was come
                        into the camp.</p>
                    <p>7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe
                        unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.</p>
                    <p>8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods?
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
                        all the plagues in the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>9 Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the
                        Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and
                        they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of
                        Israel thirty thousand footmen.</p>
                    <p>11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came
                        to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</p>
                    <p>13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for
                        the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, all
                        the city cried out.</p>
                    <p>14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>meaneth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the noise of this tumult? And the man
                        came in hastily, and told Eli.</p>
                    <p>15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.</p>
                    <p>16 And the man said unto Eli, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that came out
                        of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?</p>
                    <p>17 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath
                        been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are
                        dead, and the ark of God is taken.</p>
                    <p>18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat
                        backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and
                        heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And his daughter in law, Phinehas&rsquo; wife, was with
                        child,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>near</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to be delivered: and when she heard the
                        tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she
                        bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</p>
                    <p>20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou
                        hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>21 And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark
                        of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.</p>
                    <p>22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.</p>

                    <p>2 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it
                        by Dagon.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
                        Dagon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fallen upon his face to the earth before
                        the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</p>
                    <p>4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold,
                        Dagon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fallen upon his face to the ground before
                        the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his
                        hands<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cut off upon the threshold;
                        only<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>stump</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Dagon
                        was left to him.</p>
                    <p>5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon&rsquo;s house, tread on
                        the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.</p>
                    <p>6 But the hand of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed
                        them, and smote them with emerods,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ashdod and
                        the coasts thereof.</p>
                    <p>7 And when the men of Ashdod saw
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>so, they
                        said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and
                        upon Dagon our god.</p>
                    <p>8 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What
                        shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of
                        Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel
                        about<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thither</em>.</p>
                    <p>9 And it was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the
                        men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came
                        to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have
                        brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.</p>
                    <p>11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the
                        ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our
                        people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very
                        heavy there.</p>
                    <p>12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to
                        heaven.</p>

                    <p>AND the ark of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</p>
                    <p>2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the
                        ark of the Lord? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.</p>
                    <p>3 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise
                        return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his
                        hand is not removed from you.</p>
                    <p>4 Then said they,

                        trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five
                        golden
                        mice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                        plague<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on you all, and on your lords.</p>
                    <p>5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and
                        ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you,
                        and from off your gods, and from off your land.</p>
                    <p>6 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?
                        when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
                    </p>
                    <p>7 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and
                        tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:</p>
                    <p>8 And take the ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye
                        return him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a trespass offering, in a coffer by
                        the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.</p>
                    <p>9 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
                        Beth-shemesh,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he hath done us this great evil:
                        but if not, then we shall know

                    <p>14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there,
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great
                        stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer

                    <p>16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, they

                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had
                        looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and
                        ten men: and the people lamented, because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had
                        smitten<span>&nbsp;</span><em>many</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the people with a great slaughter.
                    </p>
                    <p>20 And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God? and to whom shall he go up from us?</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of

                        down,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fetch it up to you.</p>

                    <p>AND the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the
                        house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was
                        twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If

                        deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>4 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>only.</p>
                    <p>5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the Lord.</p>
                    <p>6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
                        poured<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out before the Lord, and fasted on that
                        day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel
                        in Mizpeh.</p>

                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, they were afraid of the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our
                        God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and
                        offered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a burnt
                        offering wholly unto the Lord: and Samuel cried unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>for Israel; and
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>heard him.</p>
                    <p>10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against
                        Israel: but the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
                        Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.</p>
                    <p>11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them,
                        until<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>came</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under

                        Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the

                        even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.
                        And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</p>
                    <p>15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</p>
                    <p>16 And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel

                    <p>4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,</p>
                    <p>5 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king
                        to judge us like all the nations.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
                        king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.</p>
                    <p>7 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all
                        that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I
                        should not reign over them.</p>
                    <p>8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of
                        Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they
                        also unto thee.</p>
                    <p>9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them
                        the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel told all the words of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto the people that asked of him a king.</p>
                    <p>11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your
                        sons, and appoint<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for himself, for his
                        chariots, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                        horsemen; and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall run before his chariots.
                    </p>
                    <p>12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>set</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of
                        his chariots.</p>
                    <p>13 And he will take your
                        daughters<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>confectionaries,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cooks,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bakers.</p>
                    <p>14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
                        oliveyards,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        best<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, and
                        give<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his servants.</p>
                    <p>15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and
                        to his servants.</p>
                    <p>16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and
                        your asses, and put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his work.</p>
                    <p>17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</p>
                    <p>18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will not hear you in that day.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of
                        Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</p>
                    <p>20 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before
                        us, and fight our battles.</p>
                    <p>21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>22 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.
                        And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW there was a man of Benjamin, whose
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror,
                        the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.</p>
                    <p>2 And he had a son, whose name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Saul, a choice
                        young man, and a goodly:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not among
                        the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and
                        upward<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>higher
                        than any of the people.</p>
                    <p>3 And the asses of Kish Saul&rsquo;s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now
                        one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</p>
                    <p>4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they
                        found<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not: then they passed through the land
                        of Shalim,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not:
                        and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they
                        found<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul
                        said to his servant that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, Come, and
                        let us return; lest my father leave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>caring</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for the
                        asses, and take thought for us.</p>
                    <p>6 And he said unto him, Behold
                        now,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in this
                        city a man of God,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an honourable
                        man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us
                        our way that we should go.</p>
                    <p>7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>we
                        go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a
                        present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</p>
                    <p>8 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a
                        shekel of silver:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will I give to the man of
                        God, to tell us our way.</p>
                    <p>9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to
                        the seer:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>called</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</p>
                    <p>10 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where
                        the man of God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as they went up the hill
                        to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer
                        here?</p>
                    <p>12 And they answered them, and said, He is;
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before
                        you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city;
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a sacrifice
                        of the people to day in the high place:</p>
                    <p>13 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the
                        high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
                        sacrifice;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>afterwards they eat that be bidden.
                        Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.</p>
                    <p>14 And they went up into the city:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when they
                        were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.
                    </p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had told Samuel in his ear
                        a day before Saul came, saying,</p>
                    <p>16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt
                        anoint him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>captain
                        over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have
                        looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</p>
                    <p>17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him, Behold the man whom I
                        spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</p>
                    <p>18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the
                        seer&rsquo;s house<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>.</p>
                    <p>19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will
                        let thee go, and will tell thee all that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        thine heart.</p>
                    <p>20 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are
                        found. And on whom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the desire of
                        Israel?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not on
                        thee, and on all thy father&rsquo;s house?</p>
                    <p>21 And Saul answered and said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not I a Benjamite,
                        of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the
                        tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>
                    <p>22 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in
                        the chiefest place among them that were bidden,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>about thirty persons.</p>
                    <p>23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee,
                        Set it by thee.</p>
                    <p>24 And the cook took up the shoulder,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon
                        it, and set<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before Saul.
                        And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Samuel</em><span>&nbsp;</span>said, Behold that which is left!
                        set<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before
                        thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>eat: for unto this time hath it been kept
                        for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p>
                    <p>25<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when they were come down from the high place into the
                        city,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Samuel</em><span>&nbsp;</span>communed with Saul upon the top of the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul
                        to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went
                        out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</p>
                    <p>27<span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as they were going down to the end of the
                        city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou
                        still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p>

                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee.</p>
                    <p>8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer
                        burnt offerings,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to sacrifice sacrifices of
                        peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt
                        do.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, that when he had
                        turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass
                        that day.</p>
                    <p>10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit
                        of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</p>
                    <p>11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among
                        the prophets, then the people said one to another,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is
                        come unto the son of Kish?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Saul also among the
                        prophets?</p>
                    <p>12 And one of the same place answered and said, But
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their father? Therefore it became a
                        proverb,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Saul also among the prophets?</p>
                    <p>13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul&rsquo;s uncle said unto him and to his servant,
                        Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no where,
                        we came to Samuel.</p>
                    <p>15 And Saul&rsquo;s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.</p>
                    <p>16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter
                        of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel called the people together unto the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to Mizpeh;</p>
                    <p>18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, I
                        brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of
                        the hand of all kingdoms,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of them that
                        oppressed you:</p>
                    <p>19 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and
                        your tribulations; and ye have said unto him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Nay</em>, but set a king
                        over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>by your tribes, and
                        by your thousands.</p>
                    <p>20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri
                        was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
                    </p>
                    <p>22 Therefore they inquired of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>further, if the man should yet come
                        thither. And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than
                        any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</p>
                    <p>24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath chosen,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none like
                        him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.</p>
                    <p>25 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
                        wrote<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in a book, and
                        laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the
                        people away, every man to his house.</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with
                        him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</p>
                    <p>27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and
                        brought him no presents. But he held his peace.</p>

                    <p>THEN Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh
                        said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</p>
                    <p>2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>condition</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will I
                        make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>covenant</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a reproach upon all Israel.</p>
                    <p>3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days&rsquo; respite, that we may send
                        messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then,
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no man to
                        save us, we will come out to thee.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
                        tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.</p>
                    <p>5 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>aileth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the people that they weep? And they
                        told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.</p>
                    <p>6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled
                        greatly.</p>
                    <p>7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and
                        sent<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>throughout all the coasts of Israel by
                        the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so
                        shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lordfell on the people, and they came out
                        with one consent.</p>
                    <p>8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the
                        men of Judah thirty thousand.</p>
                    <p>9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead,
                        To morrow,
                        by<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>time</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the sun be
                        hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and
                        shewed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
                    </p>
                    <p>10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us
                        all that seemeth good unto you.</p>
                    <p>11 And it was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the morrow, that Saul put the
                        people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and
                        slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were
                        scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the people said unto Samuel,

                        bring the men, that we may put them to death.</p>
                    <p>13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath wrought salvation in Israel.</p>
                    <p>14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before
                        the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said
                        unto me, and have made a king over you.</p>
                    <p>2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my
                        sons<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you: and I have walked before you
                        from my childhood unto this day.</p>
                    <p>3 Behold, here I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witness against me before the
                        Lord, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I
                        defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I
                        received<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?
                        and I will restore it you.</p>
                    <p>4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of
                        any man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
                    <p>5 And he said unto them, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witness against
                        you, and his anointed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witness this day, that ye
                        have not found ought in my hand. And they
                        answered,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>He</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witness.
                    </p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said unto the
                        people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of
                        the land of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>7 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of all
                        the righteous acts of the Lord, which he did to you and to your fathers.</p>
                    <p>8 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the Lord, then the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and
                        made them dwell in this place.</p>
                    <p>9 And when they forgat the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God, he sold them into the hand of
                        Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of
                        the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</p>
                    <p>10 And they cried unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord, and
                        have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will
                        serve thee.</p>
                    <p>11 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and
                        delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.</p>
                    <p>12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto
                        me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your king.</p>
                    <p>13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have
                        chosen,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whom ye have desired! and, behold, the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath set a king over you.</p>
                    <p>14 If ye will fear the Lord, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the
                        commandment of the Lord, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
                        following the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God:</p>
                    <p>15 But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the commandment of the Lord,
                        then shall the hand of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be against you,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against your
                        fathers.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will do before your eyes.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not wheat
                        harvest to day? I will call unto the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may
                        perceive and see that your wickedness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great,
                        which ye have done in the sight of the Lord, in asking you a king.</p>
                    <p>18 So Samuel called unto the Lord; and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent thunder and rain that day:
                        and all the people greatly feared the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>and Samuel.</p>
                    <p>19 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our
                        sins<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>evil, to ask us a king.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done
                        all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with all your heart;</p>
                    <p>21 And turn ye not aside:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>should</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>go</em><span>&nbsp;</span>after
                        vain<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, which cannot profit nor deliver; for
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vain.</p>
                    <p>22 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will not forsake his people for his great name&rsquo;s sake:
                        because it hath pleased the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to make you his people.</p>
                    <p>23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in ceasing
                        to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</p>
                    <p>24 Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how
                        great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he hath done for you.</p>
                    <p>25 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</p>

                    <p>SAUL reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</p>
                    <p>2 Saul chose him three thousand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        Israel;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>whereof</em><span>&nbsp;</span>two thousand were with Saul in
                        Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the
                        rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</p>
                    <p>3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Geba, and the Philistines
                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>. And Saul blew the trumpet
                        throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</p>
                    <p>4 And all Israel heard say<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Saul had smitten a
                        garrison of the Philistines, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Israel also
                        was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to
                        Gilgal.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight
                        with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the sea shore in multitude: and they
                        came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.</p>
                    <p>6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then
                        the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and
                        in pits.</p>
                    <p>7 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Hebrews
                        went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul,
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed
                        him trembling.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
                        Samuel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>appointed:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but
                        Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</p>
                    <p>9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the
                        burnt offering.</p>
                    <p>10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering,
                        behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said,
                        Because I saw that the people were scattered from me,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou camest not within the days appointed,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Philistines gathered themselves
                        together at Michmash;</p>
                    <p>12 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made
                        supplication unto the Lord: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</p>
                    <p>13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</p>
                    <p>14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath sought him a man after
                        his own heart, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath commanded
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>captain over
                        his people, because thou hast not kept<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded thee.</p>
                    <p>15 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>present
                        with him, about six hundred men.</p>
                    <p>16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>present
                        with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines
                        in three companies: one company turned unto the
                        way<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>leadeth</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ophrah,
                        unto the land of Shual:</p>
                    <p>18 And another company turned the way<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Beth-horon:
                        and another company turned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the way of the border
                        that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
                        Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews
                        make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>swords or spears:</p>
                    <p>20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his
                        coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</p>
                    <p>21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the
                        axes, and to sharpen the goads.</p>
                    <p>22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the
                        hand of any of the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with Saul and
                        Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</p>
                    <p>23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare
                        his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines&rsquo; garrison,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the other side. But he told not his
                        father.</p>
                    <p>2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Migron: and the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>about six hundred men;</p>
                    <p>3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod&rsquo;s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli,
                        the Lord&rsquo;s priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was
                        gone.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go
                        over unto the Philistines&rsquo;
                        garrison,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</p>
                    <p>5 The forefront of the one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>situate northward
                        over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</p>
                    <p>6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the
                        garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will work for us:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        restraint to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to save by many or by few.</p>
                    <p>7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in thine heart: turn thee; behold,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee according to thy heart.</p>
                    <p>8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over
                        unto<span>&nbsp;</span><em>these</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men, and we will discover ourselves unto
                        them.</p>
                    <p>9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place,
                        and will not go up unto them.</p>
                    <p>10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath
                        delivered them into our hand: and
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a sign
                        unto us.</p>
                    <p>11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the
                        Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us,
                        and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.</p>
                    <p>13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and
                        they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.</p>
                    <p>14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men,
                        within as it were an half acre of land,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        yoke<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>oxen</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>might</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>plow</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and
                        the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</p>
                    <p>16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away,
                        and they went on beating down<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>another</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 Then said Saul unto the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and
                        his
                        armourbearer<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time
                        with the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest,
                        that the noise that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the host of the
                        Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</p>
                    <p>20 And Saul and all the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him
                        assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man&rsquo;s sword was
                        against his
                        fellow,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        very great discomfiture.</p>
                    <p>21 Moreover the Hebrews<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>were with the
                        Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the
                        camp<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>country</em><span>&nbsp;</span>round
                        about, even they also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>turned</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to be with the
                        Israelites that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with Saul and Jonathan.</p>
                    <p>22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
                        Ephraim,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they heard that the Philistines fled,
                        even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</p>
                    <p>23 So the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto
                        Beth-aven.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul
                        had adjured the people, saying, Cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the man
                        that eateth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>food until evening, that I may be
                        avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people
                        tasted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>food.</p>
                    <p>25 And all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</p>
                    <p>26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his
                        hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</p>
                    <p>27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put
                        forth the end of the rod that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his hand, and
                        dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</p>
                    <p>28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an
                        oath, saying, Cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the man that
                        eateth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>food this day. And the people were
                        faint.</p>
                    <p>29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been
                        enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</p>
                    <p>30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which
                        they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</p>
                    <p>31 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very
                        faint.</p>
                    <p>32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and
                        slew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the ground: and the people did
                        eat<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the blood.</p>
                    <p>33<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin
                        against the Lord, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a
                        great stone unto me this day.</p>
                    <p>34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every
                        man his ox, and every man his sheep, and
                        slay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>here, and eat; and sin not against the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox
                        with him that night, and slew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there.</p>
                    <p>35 And Saul built an altar unto the Lord: the same was the first altar that he built unto the
                        Lord.</p>
                    <p>36<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by
                        night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they
                        said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto
                        God.</p>
                    <p>37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them
                        into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</p>
                    <p>38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this
                        sin hath been this day.</p>
                    <p>39 For,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, which
                        saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.
                        But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a man
                        among all the people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>answered him.</p>
                    <p>40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the
                        other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</p>
                    <p>41 Therefore Saul said unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, Give a
                        perfect<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lot</em>. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
                        escaped.</p>
                    <p>42 And Saul said, Cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lots</em><span>&nbsp;</span>between me and Jonathan
                        my son. And Jonathan was taken.</p>
                    <p>43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I
                        did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in mine
                        hand,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em>, lo, I must die.</p>
                    <p>44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</p>
                    <p>45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in
                        Israel? God forbid:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he
                        hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</p>
                    <p>46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
                    </p>
                    <p>47<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against
                        all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against
                        Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned
                        himself, he vexed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>48 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of
                        them that spoiled them.</p>
                    <p>49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two
                        daughters<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>these;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</p>
                    <p>50 And the name of Saul&rsquo;s wife<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ahinoam,
                        the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his
                        host<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Abner, the son of Ner, Saul&rsquo;s uncle.
                    </p>
                    <p>51 And Kish<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the father of Saul; and Ner the
                        father of Abner<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son of Abiel.</p>
                    <p>52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any
                        strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>SAMUEL also said unto Saul, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent me to anoint
                        thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>king over his
                        people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>2 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, I
                        remember<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which Amalek did to Israel, how he
                        laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>wait</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for him in the way, when he came up from
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay
                        both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</p>
                    <p>4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand
                        footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</p>
                    <p>5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down
                        from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the
                        children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the
                        Amalekites.</p>
                    <p>7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from
                        Havilah<span>&nbsp;</span><em>until</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou comest to Shur,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over against Egypt.</p>
                    <p>8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with
                        the edge of the sword.</p>
                    <p>9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the
                        fatlings, and the lambs, and
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good, and
                        would not utterly destroy them: but every
                        thing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vile and
                        refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                        Samuel, saying,</p>
                    <p>11 It repenteth me that I have set up
                        Saul<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>king: for he
                        is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel;
                        and he cried unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>all night.</p>
                    <p>12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came
                        to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down
                        to Gilgal.</p>
                    <p>13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him,
                        Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou of the Lord: I have performed the
                        commandment of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>14 And Samuel said, What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>meaneth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>then this bleating
                        of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</p>
                    <p>15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of
                        the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God; and the rest we
                        have utterly destroyed.</p>
                    <p>16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath
                        said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</p>
                    <p>17 And Samuel said, When thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>wast</em><span>&nbsp;</span>little in thine
                        own sight,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>wast</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou
                        not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>made</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>anointed thee king over Israel?</p>
                    <p>18 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the
                        sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</p>
                    <p>19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil, and
                        didst evil in the sight of the Lord?</p>
                    <p>20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have gone the way
                        which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have
                        utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</p>
                    <p>21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have
                        been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God in Gilgal.</p>
                    <p>22 And Samuel said, Hath the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>great</em><span>&nbsp;</span>delight in
                        burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to
                        obey<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than
                        sacrifice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to hearken than the fat of rams.</p>
                    <p>23 For
                        rebellion<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the sin
                        of witchcraft, and
                        stubbornness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>iniquity
                        and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee
                        from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>king.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
                        transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed
                        their voice.</p>
                    <p>25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the
                        Lord.</p>
                    <p>26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the
                        Lord, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</p>
                    <p>27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
                    </p>
                    <p>28 And Samuel said unto him, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee
                        this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
                        thine,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better
                        than thou.</p>
                    <p>29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a man, that he should repent.</p>
                    <p>30 Then he said, I have sinned:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>honour me now, I
                        pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may
                        worship the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God.</p>
                    <p>31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord.</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of
                        the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death
                        is past.</p>
                    <p>33 And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless
                        among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in Gilgal.</p>
                    <p>34<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house
                        to Gibeah of Saul.</p>
                    <p>35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned
                        for Saul: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p>

                    <p>AND the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have

                        unto me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whom I name unto thee.</p>
                    <p>4 And Samuel did that which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the
                        elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</p>
                    <p>5 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord: sanctify yourselves, and come
                        with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
                        sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked
                        on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord&rsquo;s
                        anointed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before him.</p>
                    <p>7 But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height
                        of his stature; because I have refused him:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Lord</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>seeth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>looketh
                        on the heart.</p>
                    <p>8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>chosen this.</p>
                    <p>9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>chosen
                        this.</p>
                    <p>10 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath not chosen these.</p>
                    <p>11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>children? And he said, There remaineth yet
                        the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him:
                        for we will not sit down till he come hither.</p>
                    <p>12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ruddy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>withal
                        of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, Arise,
                        anoint him: for this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he.</p>
                    <p>13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the
                        Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up,
                        and went to Ramah.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>departed
                        from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>troubled him.</p>
                    <p>15 And Saul&rsquo;s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
                    </p>
                    <p>16 Let our lord now command thy
                        servants,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before
                        thee, to seek out a
                        man,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>who</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a cunning
                        player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that
                        he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.</p>
                    <p>17 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and
                        bring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to me.</p>
                    <p>18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the
                        Beth-lehemite,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cunning
                        in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely
                        person, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send
                        me David thy son, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the sheep.</p>
                    <p>20 And Jesse took an ass<span>&nbsp;</span><em>laden</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with bread, and a
                        bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by David
                        his son unto Saul.</p>
                    <p>21 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his
                        armourbearer.</p>
                    <p>22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found
                        favour in my sight.</p>
                    <p>23 And it came to pass, when the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>evil</em><span>&nbsp;</span>spirit from
                        God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and
                        was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at
                        Shochoh, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belongeth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Judah, and pitched
                        between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.</p>
                    <p>2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and
                        set the battle in array against the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the
                        other side:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a valley
                        between them.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
                        Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose
                        height<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>six cubits and a span.</p>
                    <p>5 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an helmet of
                        brass upon his head, and he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>armed with a coat
                        of mail; and the weight of the coat<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>five
                        thousand shekels of brass.</p>
                    <p>6 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>greaves of
                        brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.</p>
                    <p>7 And the staff of his spear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like a
                        weaver&rsquo;s beam; and his spear&rsquo;s
                        head<span>&nbsp;</span><em>weighed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>six hundred shekels of iron: and one
                        bearing a shield went before him.</p>
                    <p>8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to
                        set<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>battle in
                        array?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not I a Philistine, and ye servants to
                        Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</p>
                    <p>9 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail
                        against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.</p>
                    <p>10 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may
                        fight together.</p>
                    <p>11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly
                        afraid.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now
                        David<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son of that Ephrathite of
                        Beth-lehem-judah, whose name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Jesse; and he had
                        eight sons: and the man went among men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an old
                        man in the days of Saul.</p>
                    <p>13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse
                        went<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>followed Saul to the battle: and the names
                        of his three sons that went to the
                        battle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him
                        Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</p>
                    <p>14 And David<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the youngest: and the three eldest
                        followed Saul.</p>
                    <p>15 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father&rsquo;s sheep at Beth-lehem.</p>
                    <p>16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</p>
                    <p>17 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this
                        parched<span>&nbsp;</span><em>corn</em>, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy
                        brethren;</p>
                    <p>18 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thousand, and look how thy brethren fare,
                        and take their pledge.</p>
                    <p>19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of
                        Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the valley of Elah, fighting with
                        the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David rose up early in the morning, and left the
                        sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench,
                        as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.</p>
                    <p>21 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.</p>
                    <p>22 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army,
                        and came and saluted his brethren.</p>
                    <p>23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath,
                        Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words:
                        and David heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</p>
                    <p>25 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he
                        come up: and it shall be,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the man who killeth
                        him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his
                        father&rsquo;s house free in Israel.</p>
                    <p>26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that
                        killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this uncircumcised Philistine, that he
                        should defy the armies of the living God?</p>
                    <p>27 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that
                        killeth him.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the
                        men; and Eliab&rsquo;s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down
                        hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and
                        the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</p>
                    <p>29 And David said, What have I now
                        done?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a
                        cause?</p>
                    <p>30<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And he turned from him toward another, and spake after
                        the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</p>
                    <p>31 And when the words were heard which David spake, they
                        rehearsed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before Saul: and he sent for him.
                    </p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David said to Saul, Let no man&rsquo;s heart fail
                        because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</p>
                    <p>33 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a youth,
                        and he a man of war from his youth.</p>
                    <p>34 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father&rsquo;s sheep, and there came a lion,
                        and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</p>
                    <p>35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and
                        delivered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of his mouth: and when he arose
                        against me, I caught<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by his beard, and smote
                        him, and slew him.</p>
                    <p>36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one
                        of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.</p>
                    <p>37 David said moreover, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that delivered me out of the paw of the lion,
                        and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul
                        said unto David, Go, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be with thee.</p>
                    <p>38<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an
                        helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</p>
                    <p>39 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not
                        proved<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I
                        have not proved<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>. And David put them off him.</p>
                    <p>40 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put
                        them in a shepherd&rsquo;s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his
                        sling<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his hand: and he drew near to the
                        Philistine.</p>
                    <p>41 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the
                        shield<span>&nbsp;</span><em>went</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before him.</p>
                    <p>42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he
                        was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair
                        countenance.</p>
                    <p>43 And the Philistine said unto David,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I a dog,
                        that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>
                    <p>44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the
                        air, and to the beasts of the field.</p>
                    <p>45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with
                        a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of the
                        armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</p>
                    <p>46 This day will the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee,
                        and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this
                        day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know
                        that there is a God in Israel.</p>
                    <p>47 And all this assembly shall know that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saveth not with sword and
                        spear: for the battle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord&rsquo;s, and he
                        will give you into our hands.</p>
                    <p>48 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that
                        David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</p>
                    <p>49 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
                        slang<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone
                        sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</p>
                    <p>50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the
                        Philistine, and slew him;
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no sword
                        in the hand of David.</p>
                    <p>51 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the
                        sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their
                        champion was dead, they fled.</p>
                    <p>52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou
                        come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by
                        the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</p>
                    <p>53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their
                        tents.</p>
                    <p>54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour
                        in his tent.</p>
                    <p>55<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine,
                        he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose
                        son<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this youth? And Abner
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
                    </p>
                    <p>56 And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>.</p>
                    <p>57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him
                        before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p>
                    <p>58 And Saul said to him, Whose
                        son<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span>young
                        man? And David
                        answered,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son
                        of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.</p>

                    <p>AND it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was
                        knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</p>
                    <p>2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father&rsquo;s house.</p>
                    <p>3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</p>
                    <p>4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon him, and gave it to David, and his
                        garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David went out whithersoever Saul sent
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him
                        over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight
                        of Saul&rsquo;s servants.</p>
                    <p>6 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
                        that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with
                        tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.</p>
                    <p>7 And the women
                        answered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>another</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</p>
                    <p>8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto
                        David ten thousands, and to me they have
                        ascribed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thousands:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>what</em><span>&nbsp;</span>can he have more but the kingdom?</p>
                    <p>9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit
                        from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his
                        hand, as at other times:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a javelin
                        in Saul&rsquo;s hand.</p>
                    <p>11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the
                        wall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>. And David avoided out of his
                        presence twice.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul was afraid of David, because the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was with him, and was departed from Saul.</p>
                    <p>13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out
                        and came in before the people.</p>
                    <p>14 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him.</p>
                    <p>15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</p>
                    <p>16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab,
                        her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the Lord&rsquo;s battles.
                        For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
                    </p>
                    <p>18 And David said unto Saul, Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I? and
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        life,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my father&rsquo;s family in Israel, that I
                        should be son in law to the king?</p>
                    <p>19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul&rsquo;s daughter should have been given to
                        David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</p>
                    <p>20 And Michal Saul&rsquo;s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
                    </p>
                    <p>21 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the
                        Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
                        law
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        twain.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul commanded his
                        servants,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the
                        king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king&rsquo;s son
                        in law.</p>
                    <p>23 And Saul&rsquo;s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it
                        to
                        you<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span>light<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        be a king&rsquo;s son in law, seeing that I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        poor man, and lightly esteemed?</p>
                    <p>24 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.</p>
                    <p>25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred
                        foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king&rsquo;s enemies. But Saul thought to
                        make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king&rsquo;s son
                        in law: and the days were not expired.</p>
                    <p>27 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men;
                        and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be
                        the king&rsquo;s son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Saul saw and knew that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with David,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Michal Saul&rsquo;s daughter loved him.
                    </p>
                    <p>29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David&rsquo;s enemy continually.
                    </p>
                    <p>30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went
                        forth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>David behaved himself more wisely than
                        all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</p>

                    <p>AND Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.</p>
                    <p>2 But Jonathan Saul&rsquo;s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my
                        father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning,
                        and abide in a secret<span>&nbsp;</span><em>place</em>, and hide thyself:</p>
                    <p>3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em>, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see,

                        said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not
                        sinned against thee, and because his
                        works<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        thee-ward very good:</p>
                    <p>5 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
                        sawest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against
                        innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</p>
                    <p>6 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul
                        sware,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, he
                        shall not be slain.</p>
                    <p>7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David
                        to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought
                        with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</p>
                    <p>9 And the evil spirit from the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with
                        his javelin in his hand: and David played
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hand.</p>
                    <p>10 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of
                        Saul&rsquo;s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that
                        night.</p>
                    <p>11 Saul also sent messengers unto David&rsquo;s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the
                        morning: and Michal David&rsquo;s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to

                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Michal let David down through a window: and he went,
                        and fled, and escaped.</p>
                    <p>13 And Michal took an image, and laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the bed,
                        and put a pillow of goats&rsquo;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hair</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for his

                    <p>15 And Saul sent the messengers<span>&nbsp;</span><em>again</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to see David,
                        saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</p>
                    <p>16 And when the messengers were come in,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                        image in the bed, with a pillow of
                        goats&rsquo;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hair</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for his bolster.</p>
                    <p>17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is
                        escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
                        and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</p>
                    <p>19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at
                        Naioth in Ramah.</p>
                    <p>20 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets
                        prophesying, and Samuel standing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>appointed over
                        them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</p>
                    <p>21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul
                        sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</p>
                    <p>22 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Sechu: and he asked and said,
                        Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Samuel and David?
                        And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>said,
                        Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at
                        Naioth in Ramah.</p>
                    <p>23 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went
                        on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</p>
                    <p>24 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay
                        down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they
                        say,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Saul also among the prophets?</p>

                    <p>AND David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done?
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine iniquity? and
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my sin before thy father, that he seeketh
                        my life?</p>
                    <p>2 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either
                        great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me?
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>.</p>
                    <p>3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in
                        thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but
                        truly<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy soul
                        liveth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but a
                        step between me and death.</p>
                    <p>4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even
                        do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for thee.</p>
                    <p>5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to
                        morrow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the new moon, and I should not fail to
                        sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the
                        third<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at even.</p>
                    <p>6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly
                        asked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>leave</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of me that he might run to Beth-lehem
                        his city: for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</p>
                    <p>7 If he say
                        thus,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>well; thy
                        servant shall have peace: but if he be very
                        wroth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be sure that evil is determined by him.
                    </p>
                    <p>8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a
                        covenant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity,
                        slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p>
                    <p>9 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my
                        father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</p>
                    <p>10 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy father answer thee roughly?</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out
                        into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</p>
                    <p>12 And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, when I have sounded my
                        father about to morrow any time,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        third<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em>, and,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good
                        toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</p>
                    <p>13 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my
                        father<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thee evil,
                        then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p>
                    <p>14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the Lord, that I die not:</p>
                    <p>15 But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>also</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from
                        my house for ever: no, not when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath cut off the enemies of David
                        every one from the face of the earth.</p>
                    <p>16 So Jonathan
                        made<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>covenant</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the
                        house of David,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Let the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>even
                        require<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the hand of David&rsquo;s enemies.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved
                        his own soul.</p>
                    <p>18 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the new
                        moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</p>
                    <p>19 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast stayed three
                        days,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt go down quickly, and come to
                        the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business
                        was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>hand</em>, and shalt remain by the stone
                        Ezel.</p>
                    <p>20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thereof</em>, as though I shot
                        at a mark.</p>
                    <p>21 And, behold, I will send a lad,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Go, find out the arrows. If
                        I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the
                        arrows<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on this side of thee, take them; then
                        come thou:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>peace to
                        thee, and no hurt;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth.</p>
                    <p>22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the
                        arrows<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beyond thee; go thy way: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath sent thee away.</p>
                    <p>23 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>touching</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>between thee and me for ever.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon
                        was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</p>
                    <p>25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other
                        times,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan
                        arose, and Abner sat by Saul&rsquo;s side, and David&rsquo;s place was empty.</p>
                    <p>26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him,
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not clean; surely
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not clean.</p>
                    <p>27 And it came to pass on the
                        morrow,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        second<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the month, that David&rsquo;s place
                        was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat,
                        neither yesterday, nor to day?</p>
                    <p>28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly
                        asked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>leave</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>go</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Beth-lehem:
                    </p>
                    <p>29 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my
                        brother, he hath commanded
                        me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and
                        now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.
                        Therefore he cometh not unto the king&rsquo;s table.</p>
                    <p>30 Then Saul&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the
                        perverse rebellious<span>&nbsp;</span><em>woman</em>, do not I know that thou hast chosen the
                        son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother&rsquo;s nakedness?</p>
                    <p>31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy
                        kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</p>
                    <p>32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what
                        hath he done?</p>
                    <p>33 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of
                        his father to slay David.</p>
                    <p>34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the
                        month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</p>
                    <p>35<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went
                        out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</p>
                    <p>36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
                        shoot.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond
                        him.</p>
                    <p>37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried
                        after the lad, and said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not the arrow beyond
                        thee?</p>
                    <p>38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan&rsquo;s lad
                        gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</p>
                    <p>39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>
                    <p>40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go,
                        carry<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the city.</p>
                    <p>41<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as soon as the lad was
                        gone, David arose out
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>place</em><span>&nbsp;</span>toward the
                        south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one
                        another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</p>
                    <p>42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of
                        the Lord, saying, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy
                        seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</p>

                    <p>THEN came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David,

                        bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at
                        least from women.</p>
                    <p>5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
                        women<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>kept
                        from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>bread</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</p>
                    <p>6 So the priest gave him hallowed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>bread:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for there
                        was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the Lord, to put hot bread in
                        the day when it was taken away.</p>
                    <p>7 Now a certain man of the servants of
                        Saul<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there that day, detained before the Lord;
                        and his name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of
                        the herdmen that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belonged</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Saul.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
                        thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because
                        the king&rsquo;s business required haste.</p>
                    <p>9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of
                        Elah, behold,
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>here</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wrapped in a
                        cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that,
                        take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        other save that here. And David
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none like
                        that; give it me.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and
                        went to Achish the king of Gath.</p>
                    <p>11 And the servants of Achish said unto him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul
                        hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
                    <p>12 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and
                        scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</p>
                    <p>14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
                        wherefore<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>have ye brought him to me?</p>
                    <p>15 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>fellow</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to play the mad man in my presence?
                        shall this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>fellow</em><span>&nbsp;</span>come into my house?</p>

                    <p>DAVID therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all
                        his father&rsquo;s house heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, they went down thither to him.</p>
                    <p>2 And every

                        gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about
                        four hundred men.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto
                        the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
                        forth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you,
                        till I know what God will do for me.</p>
                    <p>4 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David
                        was in the hold.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the
                        hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest
                        of Hareth.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under
                        a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his
                        servants<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>standing about him;)</p>
                    <p>7 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of
                        Jesse give every one of you fields and
                        vineyards,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>make you all captains of thousands,
                        and captains of hundreds;</p>
                    <p>8 That all of you have conspired against me,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none that
                        sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none of you
                        that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to

                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the
                        servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of
                        Ahitub.</p>
                    <p>10 And he inquired of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the
                        sword of Goliath the Philistine.</p>
                    <p>11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father&rsquo;s
                        house, the priests that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Nob: and they came
                        all of them to the king.</p>
                    <p>12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em>, my lord.</p>
                    <p>13 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that
                        thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise
                        against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</p>
                    <p>14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>faithful among
                        all thy servants as David, which is the king&rsquo;s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and
                        is honourable in thine house?</p>
                    <p>15 Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king
                        impute<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thing unto his
                        servant,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nor</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to all the house of my father: for thy
                        servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</p>
                    <p>16 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father&rsquo;s house.
                    </p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him,
                        Turn, and slay the priests of the Lord; because their hand
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with David, and because they knew when he
                        fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to
                        fall upon the priests of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned,
                        and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a
                        linen ephod.</p>
                    <p>19 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women,
                        children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
                        Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</p>
                    <p>21 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the Lord&rsquo;s priests.</p>
                    <p>22 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that day,
                        when Doeg the Edomite<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there, that he would
                        surely tell Saul: I have
                        occasioned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>death</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        all the persons of thy father&rsquo;s house.</p>
                    <p>23 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shalt</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in

                    <p>THEN they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the
                        threshingfloors.</p>
                    <p>2 Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</p>
                    <p>3 And David&rsquo;s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if
                        we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</p>
                    <p>4 Then David inquired of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>yet again. And the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the
                        Philistines into thine hand.</p>
                    <p>5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their
                        cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p>
                    <p>6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to
                        Keilah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he came
                        down<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an ephod in his hand.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And
                        Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town
                        that hath gates and bars.</p>
                    <p>8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his
                        men.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief
                        against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</p>
                    <p>10 Then said David, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that
                        Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</p>
                    <p>11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath
                        heard? O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, He will come down.</p>
                    <p>12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, They will
                        deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then David and his
                        men,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>about
                        six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was
                        told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.</p>
                    <p>14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the
                        wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</p>
                    <p>15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
                        David<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Jonathan Saul&rsquo;s son arose, and went to David
                        into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</p>
                    <p>17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou
                        shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
                    </p>
                    <p>18 And they two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went
                        to his house.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth
                        not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the south of Jeshimon?</p>
                    <p>20 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our
                        part<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to deliver
                        him into the king&rsquo;s hand.</p>
                    <p>21 And Saul said, Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye of the Lord; for ye
                        have compassion on me.</p>
                    <p>22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt
                        is,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>who hath seen him there: for it is told
                        me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he dealeth very subtilly.</p>
                    <p>23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come
                        ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be
                        in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</p>
                    <p>24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his
                        men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on
                        the south of Jeshimon.</p>
                    <p>25 Saul also and his men went to seek<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>. And they told David:
                        wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul
                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em>, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</p>
                    <p>26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the
                        mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed
                        David and his men round about to take them.</p>
                    <p>27<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee,
                        and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</p>
                    <p>28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore
                        they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.</p>
                    <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds
                        at En-gedi.</p>

                    <p>AND it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him,
                        saying, Behold, David<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the wilderness of
                        En-gedi.</p>
                    <p>2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men
                        upon the rocks of the wild goats.</p>
                    <p>3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way,
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a cave; and Saul went in to cover his
                        feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</p>
                    <p>4 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said
                        unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it
                        shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul&rsquo;s robe privily.
                    </p>
                    <p>5 And it came to pass afterward, that David&rsquo;s heart smote him, because he had cut off
                        Saul&rsquo;s skirt.</p>
                    <p>6 And he said unto his men, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>forbid that I should do this thing unto my
                        master, the Lord&rsquo;s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the anointed of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>7 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But
                        Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>way.
                    </p>
                    <p>8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the
                        king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men&rsquo;s
                        words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</p>
                    <p>10 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had delivered thee
                        to day into mine hand in the cave:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bade<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>kill
                        thee:
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>mine</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>eye</em><span>&nbsp;</span>spared
                        thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.</p>
                    <p>11 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the
                        skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>neither
                        evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my
                        soul to take it.</p>
                    <p>12 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>judge between me and thee, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>avenge me
                        of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
                    <p>13 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand
                        shall not be upon thee.</p>
                    <p>14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog,
                        after a flea.</p>
                    <p>15 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and
                        plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of
                        speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this thy voice, my son David? And Saul
                        lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
                    <p>17 And he said to David, Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>more righteous
                        than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</p>
                    <p>18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</p>
                    <p>19 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</p>
                    <p>20 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel
                        shall be established in thine hand.</p>
                    <p>21 Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that
                        thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father&rsquo;s house.</p>
                    <p>22 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the
                        hold.</p>

                    <p>AND Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him
                        in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</p>
                    <p>2 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a man in
                        Maon, whose possessions<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Carmel; and the
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very great, and he had three thousand
                        sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</p>
                    <p>3 Now the name of the man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Nabal; and the name of
                        his wife Abigail:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>she</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a woman of
                        good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>churlish and evil in his doings; and
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the house of Caleb.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
                        sheep.</p>
                    <p>5 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and
                        go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</p>
                    <p>6 And thus shall ye say to him that
                        liveth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>prosperity</em>,
                        Peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>both to thee, and
                        peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to thine house, and
                        peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto all that thou hast.</p>
                    <p>7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt
                        them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</p>
                    <p>8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine
                        eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy
                        servants, and to thy son David.</p>
                    <p>9 And when David&rsquo;s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the
                        name of David, and ceased.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Nabal answered David&rsquo;s servants, and said,
                        Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>David? and
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son of Jesse? there be many servants now
                        a days that break away every man from his master.</p>
                    <p>11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and
                        give<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto men, whom I know not whence
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be?</em></p>
                    <p>12 So David&rsquo;s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those
                        sayings.</p>
                    <p>13 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his
                        sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men;
                        and two hundred abode by the stuff.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal&rsquo;s
                        wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he
                        railed on them.</p>
                    <p>15 But the men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very good unto us, and we were
                        not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in
                        the fields:</p>
                    <p>16 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the
                        sheep.</p>
                    <p>17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master,
                        and against all his household: for
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>such</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a son of
                        Belial,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cannot speak
                        to him.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and
                        two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of
                        parched<span>&nbsp;</span><em>corn</em>, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred
                        cakes of figs, and laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on asses.</p>
                    <p>19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not
                        her husband Nabal.</p>
                    <p>20 And it was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she
                        rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men
                        came down against her; and she met them.</p>
                    <p>21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>fellow</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hath in the wilderness, so that nothing
                        was missed of all that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pertained</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto him: and he
                        hath requited me evil for good.</p>
                    <p>22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pertain</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to him by the morning light any that
                        pisseth against the wall.</p>
                    <p>23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her
                        face, and bowed herself to the ground,</p>
                    <p>24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my
                        lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>upon</em><span>&nbsp;</span>me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>iniquity<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and
                        let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.
                    </p>
                    <p>25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of
                        Belial,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Nabal: for as his
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>, so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he;
                        Nabal<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name, and
                        folly<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the
                        young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</p>
                    <p>26 Now therefore, my lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy soul
                        liveth, seeing the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath withholden thee from coming
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blood, and from avenging thyself with thine
                        own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</p>
                    <p>27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given
                        unto the young men that follow my lord.</p>
                    <p>28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will
                        certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the Lord, and evil
                        hath not been found in thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>all</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy days.</p>
                    <p>29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be
                        bound in the bundle of life with the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God; and the souls of thine
                        enemies, them shall he sling
                        out,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>out</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                        middle of a sling.</p>
                    <p>30 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall have done to my lord
                        according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee
                        ruler over Israel;</p>
                    <p>31 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou
                        hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David said to Abigail,
                        Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of
                        Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:</p>
                    <p>33 And blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy advice, and
                        blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou, which hast kept me this day from
                        coming to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blood, and from avenging myself with
                        mine own hand.</p>
                    <p>34 For in very deed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except
                        thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning
                        light any that pisseth against the wall.</p>
                    <p>35 So David received of her hand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which she had
                        brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy
                        voice, and have accepted thy person.</p>
                    <p>36<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast
                        in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal&rsquo;s
                        heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>merry within him, for
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very drunken: wherefore she told him
                        nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</p>
                    <p>37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told
                        him these things, that his heart died within him, and he
                        became<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a stone.</p>
                    <p>38 And it came to pass about ten days<span>&nbsp;</span><em>after</em>, that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>smote Nabal, that he died.</p>
                    <p>39<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said,
                        Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord, that hath pleaded the cause of
                        my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent
                        and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</p>
                    <p>40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying,
                        David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.</p>
                    <p>41 And she arose, and bowed herself on<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>face to
                        the earth, and said, Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine
                        handmaid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a servant to wash the feet of the
                        servants of my lord.</p>
                    <p>42 And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after
                        her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</p>
                    <p>43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.</p>
                    <p>44<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David&rsquo;s
                        wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        Gallim.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of
                        Hachilah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before
                        Jeshimon?</p>
                    <p>2 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of
                        Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</p>
                    <p>3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before Jeshimon, by the way. But David
                        abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had
                        pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his
                        host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</p>
                    <p>6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah,
                        brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will
                        go down with thee.</p>
                    <p>7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the
                        trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round
                        about him.</p>
                    <p>8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now
                        therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will
                        not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>smite</em><span>&nbsp;</span>him the second time.</p>
                    <p>9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the
                        Lord&rsquo;s anointed, and be guiltless?</p>
                    <p>10 David said furthermore,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall smite him; or his day shall come
                        to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</p>
                    <p>11 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the
                        Lord&rsquo;s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and
                        let us go.</p>
                    <p>12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul&rsquo;s bolster; and they gat them
                        away, and no man saw<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, nor knew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>,
                        neither awaked: for they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all asleep; because a
                        deep sleep from the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was fallen upon them.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the
                        top of an hill afar off; a great
                        space<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>between them:</p>
                    <p>14 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner?
                        Then Abner answered and said,
                        Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>criest
                        to the king?</p>
                    <p>15 And David said to Abner,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not thou
                        a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>valiant</em><span>&nbsp;</span>man? and
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast
                        thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy
                        lord.</p>
                    <p>16 This thing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not good that thou hast
                        done.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth,
                        ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
                        master, the Lord&rsquo;s anointed. And now see where the king&rsquo;s
                        spear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>, and the cruse of water
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at his bolster.</p>
                    <p>17 And Saul knew David&rsquo;s voice, and
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this thy voice, my son David? And David
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my voice, my
                        lord, O king.</p>
                    <p>18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or
                        what evil<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in mine hand?</p>
                    <p>19 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the children
                        of men, cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they before the Lord; for they
                        have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other
                        gods.</p>
                    <p>20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord: for the king of
                        Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for
                        I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have
                        played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</p>
                    <p>22 And David answered and said, Behold the king&rsquo;s spear! and let one of the young men come
                        over and fetch it.</p>
                    <p>23 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered thee into<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hand
                        to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the Lord&rsquo;s anointed.</p>
                    <p>24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by
                        in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</p>
                    <p>25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou, my son
                        David: thou shalt both do great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, and also shalt still prevail.
                        So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of
                        Saul:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing
                        better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul
                        shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>2 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch,
                        king of Gath.</p>
                    <p>3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his
                        household,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>David with his two wives, Ahinoam

                    <p>4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in
                        thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for
                        why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</p>
                    <p>6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto
                        this day.</p>
                    <p>7 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four
                        months.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites,
                        and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for
                        those<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nations</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>9 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and
                        the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.</p>
                    <p>10 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of
                        Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</p>
                    <p>11 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to
                        bring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>tidings</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Gath, saying, Lest they should
                        tell on us, saying, So did David, and

                    <p>12 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him;
                        therefore he shall be my servant for ever.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for
                        warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt
                        go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.</p>
                    <p>2 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to
                        David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
                        buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar
                        spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</p>
                    <p>4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul
                        gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.</p>
                    <p>5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
                    </p>
                    <p>6 And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered him not, neither by
                        dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that
                        hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him,
                        Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a woman
                        that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.</p>
                    <p>8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and
                        they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar
                        spirit, and bring me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up, whom I shall name unto
                        thee.</p>
                    <p>9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off
                        those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a
                        snare for my life, to cause me to die?</p>
                    <p>10 And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</p>
                    <p>11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</p>
                    <p>12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul,
                        saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Saul.</p>
                    <p>13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul,
                        I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</p>
                    <p>14 And he said unto her, What form<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he of? And she
                        said, An old man cometh up; and he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>covered with
                        a mantle. And Saul perceived that it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Samuel,
                        and he stooped with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>face to the ground, and
                        bowed himself.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to
                        bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me,
                        and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
                        therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</p>
                    <p>16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>is
                        departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?</p>
                    <p>17 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
                        neighbour,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to David:</p>
                    <p>18 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek,
                        therefore hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>done this thing unto thee this day.</p>
                    <p>19 Moreover the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the
                        Philistines: and to morrow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shalt</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou and thy
                        sons<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with me: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>also
                        shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words
                        of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the
                        night.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
                        troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my
                        life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.</p>
                    <p>22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set
                        a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy
                        way.</p>
                    <p>23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled
                        him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</p>
                    <p>24 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and
                        kneaded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</p>
                    <p>25 And she brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before Saul, and before his
                        servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</p>

                    <p>NOW the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a
                        fountain which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Jezreel.</p>
                    <p>2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men
                        passed on in the rereward with Achish.</p>
                    <p>3 Then said the princes of the Philistines,

                        Hebrews<span>&nbsp;</span><em>here?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>And Achish said unto the princes of
                        the Philistines,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not this David, the servant of
                        Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no
                        fault in him since he
                        fell<span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto this
                        day?</p>
                    <p>4 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said
                        unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed
                        him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for
                        wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his
                        master?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>should</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with

                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not this David, of whom they sang one to
                        another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Achish called David, and said unto him,
                        Surely,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, thou
                        hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the
                        host<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good in my sight: for I have not found evil
                        in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee
                        not.</p>
                    <p>7 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
                    </p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what
                        hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go
                        fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</p>
                    <p>9 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good in my sight, as an angel of God:
                        notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the
                        battle.</p>
                    <p>10 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master&rsquo;s servants that are come with
                        thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</p>
                    <p>11 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the

                    <p>AND it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the
                        Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</p>
                    <p>2 And had taken the women captives,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein: they slew not any, either great
                        or small, but carried<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away, and went on their

                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So David and his men came to the city, and,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>burned
                        with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</p>
                    <p>4 Then David and the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him
                        lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</p>
                    <p>5 And David&rsquo;s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife
                        of Nabal the Carmelite.</p>
                    <p>6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all
                        the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged
                        himself in the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>his God.</p>
                    <p>7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech&rsquo;s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the
                        ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</p>
                    <p>8 And David inquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them?
                        And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, and
                        without fail recover<span>&nbsp;</span><em>all</em>.</p>
                    <p>9 So David went, he and the six hundred men
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, and came to the brook Besor,
                        where those that were left behind stayed.</p>
                    <p>10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint
                        that they could not go over the brook Besor.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him
                        to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</p>
                    <p>12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had
                        eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor
                        drunk<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>water, three days and three nights.</p>
                    <p>13 And David said unto him, To whom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belongest</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou?
                        and whence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou? And he said,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;
                        and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.</p>
                    <p>14 We made an invasion<span>&nbsp;</span><em>upon</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the south of the
                        Cherethites, and
                        upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>coast</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belongeth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</p>
                    <p>15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by
                        God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will
                        bring thee down to this company.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when he had brought him down,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>spread
                        abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that
                        they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</p>
                    <p>17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there
                        escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</p>
                    <p>18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
                    </p>
                    <p>19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters,
                        neither spoil, nor any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that they had taken to
                        them: David recovered all.</p>
                    <p>20 And David took all the flocks and the
                        herds,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they drave before
                        those<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cattle, and said,
                        This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>David&rsquo;s spoil.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And David came to the two hundred men, which were so
                        faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and
                        they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him: and when David came near to the
                        people, he saluted them.</p>
                    <p>22 Then answered all the wicked men and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give
                        them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ought</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the spoil that we have recovered,
                        save to every man his wife and his children, that they may
                        lead<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away, and depart.</p>
                    <p>23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came
                        against us into our hand.</p>
                    <p>24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his
                        part<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that goeth down to the battle,
                        so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                        part<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part
                        alike.</p>
                    <p>25 And it was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from that day forward, that he made
                        it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto
                        the elders of Judah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his friends, saying,
                        Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the Lord;</p>
                    <p>27

                    <p>NOW the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the
                        Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</p>
                    <p>2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew
                        Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul&rsquo;s sons.</p>
                    <p>3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the
                        archers.</p>
                    <p>4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest
                        these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not;
                        for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</p>
                    <p>5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died
                        with him.</p>
                    <p>6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day
                        together.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when the men of Israel
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the other side of the valley,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on
                        the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
                        they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</p>
                    <p>8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they
                        found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
                    <p>9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the
                        Philistines round about, to
                        publish<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the house
                        of their idols, and among the people.</p>
                    <p>10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of
                        Beth-shan.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that
                        which the Philistines had done to Saul;</p>
                    <p>12 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his
                        sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</p>
                    <p>13 And they took their bones, and buried<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under
                        a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>
