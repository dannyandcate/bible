                    <p>NOW after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>it came to pass, that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses&rsquo; minister, saying,</p>
                    <p>2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people,
                        unto the land which I do give to them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the
                        children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said
                        unto Moses.</p>
                    <p>4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the
                        land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your
                        coast.</p>
                    <p>5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with
                        Moses,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will be with thee: I will not fail
                        thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
                    <p>6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
                        land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</p>
                    <p>7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the
                        law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the right hand
                        or<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the left, that thou mayest prosper
                        whithersoever thou goest.</p>
                    <p>8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and
                        night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou
                        shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</p>
                    <p>9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
                        dismayed: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
                    </p>
                    <p>11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three
                        days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God giveth you to possess it.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half
                        the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</p>
                    <p>13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded you, saying,
                        The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</p>
                    <p>14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you
                        on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour,
                        and help them;</p>
                    <p>15 Until the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>have given your brethren rest,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>given</em><span>&nbsp;</span>you,
                        and they also have possessed the land which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God giveth them:
                        then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the
                        Lord&rsquo;s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou
                        commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</p>
                    <p>17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</p>
                    <p>18 Whosoever<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou
                        commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land,
                        even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot&rsquo;s house, named Rahab, and lodged
                        there.</p>
                    <p>2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the
                        children of Israel to search out the country.</p>
                    <p>3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee,
                        which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</p>
                    <p>4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist
                        not whence they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were:</em></p>
                    <p>5 And it came to
                        pass<span>&nbsp;</span><em>about</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>time</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not:
                        pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</p>
                    <p>6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax,
                        which she had laid in order upon the roof.</p>
                    <p>7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which
                        pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon
                        the roof;</p>
                    <p>9 And she said unto the men, I know that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given you the land, and
                        that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of
                        you.</p>
                    <p>10 For we have heard how the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>dried up the water of the Red sea for you,
                        when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og,
                        whom ye utterly destroyed.</p>
                    <p>11 And as soon as we had
                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>these</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, our hearts did melt,
                        neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God in
                        heaven above, and in earth beneath.</p>
                    <p>12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord, since I have shewed you kindness, that
                        ye will also shew kindness unto my father&rsquo;s house, and give me a true token:</p>
                    <p>13 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye will save alive my father, and my
                        mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from
                        death.</p>
                    <p>14 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall
                        be, when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly
                        with thee.</p>
                    <p>15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
                        house<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon
                        the wall.</p>
                    <p>16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide
                        yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 And the men said unto her,
                        We<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blameless of
                        this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</p>
                    <p>18 Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>we come into the land, thou shalt
                        bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt
                        bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father&rsquo;s household, home
                        unto thee.</p>
                    <p>19 And it shall be,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whosoever shall go out of
                        the doors of thy house into the street, his
                        blood<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon his
                        head, and
                        we<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>guiltless:
                        and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his
                        blood<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on our
                        head, if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hand be upon him.</p>
                    <p>20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made
                        us to swear.</p>
                    <p>21 And she said, According unto your words,
                        so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it. And she sent them away, and they
                        departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</p>
                    <p>22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were
                        returned: and the pursuers sought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>throughout
                        all the way, but found<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not.</p>
                    <p>23<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain,
                        and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that befell them:</p>
                    <p>24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath delivered into our hands all
                        the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</p>

                    <p>AND Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and
                        all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</p>
                    <p>2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</p>
                    <p>3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the

                    <p>6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over
                        before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Joshua, This day

                    <p>11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into
                        Jordan.</p>
                    <p>12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</p>

                        of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of
                        Jordan,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the waters of Jordan shall be cut

                    <p>15 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the
                        ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of
                        harvest,)</p>
                    <p>16 That the waters which came down from above

                        city Adam, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beside Zaretan: and those that
                        came down toward the sea of the plain,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        salt sea, failed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>were cut off: and the people
                        passed over right against Jericho.</p>
                    <p>17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>stood firm on
                        dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all

                    <p>2 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</p>
                    <p>3 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where
                        the priests&rsquo; feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and
                        leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</p>
                    <p>4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every
                        tribe a man:</p>
                    <p>5 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God into
                        the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto
                        the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</p>
                    <p>6 That this may be a sign among you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when your

                        ask<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>fathers</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in

                    <p>7 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the

                        stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</p>
                    <p>8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the
                        midst of Jordan, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the
                        tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they
                        lodged, and laid them down there.</p>
                    <p>9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the
                        priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
                        Jordan, until every thing was finished that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Joshua to speak
                        unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed
                        over.</p>
                    <p>11 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the

                    <p>13 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto

                    <p>15 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake unto Joshua, saying,</p>

                    <p>17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</p>
                    <p>18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>were come up out of the midst of

                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the people came up out of Jordan on the

                    <p>20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.</p>
                    <p>21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers

                        the kings of the Canaanites, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the sea,

                    <p>4 And this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the cause why Joshua did circumcise:

                    <p>5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the

                    <p>6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the

                        war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: unto
                        whom the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sware that he would not shew them the land, which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with
                        milk and honey.</p>
                    <p>7 And their children,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>whom</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he raised up in their
                        stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised
                        them by the way.</p>
                    <p>8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their

                        Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept
                        the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</p>
                    <p>11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened

                        of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat
                        of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
                        lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword
                        drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou for us, or for our adversaries?</p>
                    <p>14 And he said, Nay; but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>captain of the host of
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
                        worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</p>
                    <p>15 And the captain of the Lord&rsquo;s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot;

                        on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p>
                    <p>10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your
                        voice, neither shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>word proceed out of your
                        mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</p>
                    <p>11 So the ark of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>compassed the city, going
                        about<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>once: and they came into the camp, and
                        lodged in the camp.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests
                        took up the ark of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the ark of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went
                        before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>priests</em><span>&nbsp;</span>going
                        on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p>
                    <p>14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six
                        days.</p>
                    <p>15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and
                        compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city
                        seven times.</p>
                    <p>16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said
                        unto the people, Shout; for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given you the city.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the city shall be
                        accursed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it, and all
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein, to the Lord: only Rahab the
                        harlot shall live, she and all that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with her in
                        the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</p>
                    <p>18 And ye, in any wise keep<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yourselves</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the
                        accursed thing, lest ye make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yourselves</em><span>&nbsp;</span>accursed,
                        when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</p>
                    <p>19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and
                        iron,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>consecrated unto the Lord: they shall
                        come into the treasury of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>20 So the people shouted
                        when<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>priests</em><span>&nbsp;</span>blew
                        with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the
                        people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into
                        the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</p>
                    <p>21 And they utterly destroyed all that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                        city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
                    </p>
                    <p>22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the
                        harlot&rsquo;s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto
                        her.</p>
                    <p>23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her
                        mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left
                        them without the camp of Israel.</p>
                    <p>24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein: only the silver, and the gold,
                        and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father&rsquo;s household, and all that she
                        had; and she dwelleth in Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto this day;
                        because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua
                        adjured<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at that time, saying,
                        Cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the man before the Lord, that riseth up
                        and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his
                        youngest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>son</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall he set up the gates of it.</p>
                    <p>27 So the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was with Joshua; and his fame
                        was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>noised</em><span>&nbsp;</span>throughout all the country.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>BUT the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of
                        Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing:
                        and the anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was kindled against the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beside Beth-aven, on the east side of
                        Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed
                        Ai.</p>
                    <p>3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two
                        or three thousand men go up and smite Ai;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>make
                        not all the people to labour thither; for
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>few.</p>
                    <p>4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men
                        of Ai.</p>
                    <p>5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased
                        them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before the
                        gate<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto Shebarim, and smote them in the
                        going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon
                        his face before the ark of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>until the eventide, he and the elders of
                        Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</p>
                    <p>7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan,
                        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content,
                        and dwelt on the other side Jordan!</p>
                    <p>8 O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</p>
                    <p>9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
                        hear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and shall environ us round,
                        and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Joshua, Get thee
                        up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</p>
                    <p>11 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for
                        they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they
                        have put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>even among their own stuff.</p>
                    <p>12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
                        enemies,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>turned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>backs
                        before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye
                        destroy the accursed from among you.</p>
                    <p>13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of
                        Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                        accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until
                        ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</p>
                    <p>14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall
                        be,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the tribe which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>taketh shall come according to the
                        families<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thereof;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and the family which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall take shall come by households; and the household which the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall take shall come man by man.</p>
                    <p>15 And it shall be,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that is taken with the
                        accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed
                        the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought
                        Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</p>
                    <p>17 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the
                        family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</p>
                    <p>18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the
                        son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p>
                    <p>19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God
                        of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done;
                        hide<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not from me.</p>
                    <p>20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</p>
                    <p>21 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver,
                        and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold,
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hid in the earth in the midst of my tent,
                        and the silver under it.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent;
                        and, behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hid
                        in his tent, and the silver under it.</p>
                    <p>23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all
                        the children of Israel, and laid them out before the Lord.</p>
                    <p>24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the
                        garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses,
                        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of
                        Achor.</p>
                    <p>25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall trouble thee this
                        day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned
                        them with stones.</p>
                    <p>26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place
                        was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</p>

                    <p>AND the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the
                        people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai,
                        and his people, and his city, and his land:</p>
                    <p>2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil
                        thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush

                    <p>4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the

                        the city, but be ye all ready:</p>
                    <p>5 And I, and all the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with me, will
                        approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the
                        first, that we will flee before them,</p>
                    <p>6 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say,
                        They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.</p>
                    <p>7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God will deliver it into your hand.</p>
                    <p>8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the

                        now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a valley
                        between them and Ai.</p>
                    <p>12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on
                        the west side of the city.</p>
                    <p>13 And when they had set the people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the
                        host that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the north of the city, and their
                        liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai
                        saw<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city
                        went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
                        but he wist not
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>liers in
                        ambush against him behind the city.</p>
                    <p>15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the
                        wilderness.</p>
                    <p>16 And all the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Ai were called
                        together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left
                        the city open, and pursued after Israel.</p>
                    <p>18 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it
                        into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his hand
                        toward the city.</p>
                    <p>19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out
                        his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</p>
                    <p>20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city
                        ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that
                        fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</p>
                    <p>21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of
                        the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</p>
                    <p>22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some
                        on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain
                        or escape.</p>
                    <p>23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</p>
                    <p>24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the
                        field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of
                        the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with
                        the edge of the sword.</p>
                    <p>25 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it
                        was,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all that fell that day, both of men and
                        women,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>twelve
                        thousand,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the men of Ai.</p>
                    <p>26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly
                        destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</p>
                    <p>27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according
                        unto the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>which he commanded Joshua.</p>
                    <p>28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for
                        ever,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a desolation unto this day.</p>
                    <p>29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua
                        commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of
                        the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of
                        stones,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><em>remaineth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto this day.</p>
                    <p>30<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua built an altar unto the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel in mount Ebal,</p>
                    <p>31 As Moses the servant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded the children of Israel, as it is
                        written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift
                        up<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>iron: and they offered thereon burnt
                        offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of
                        Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>33 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark
                        and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
                        as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim,
                        and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had
                        commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.</p>
                    <p>34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all
                        that is written in the book of the law.</p>
                    <p>35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the
                        congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were
                        conversant among them.</p>

                    <p>AND it came to pass, when all the kings
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on this side Jordan, in the hills, and
                        in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
                        the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thereof;</em></p>
                    <p>2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
                    </p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had
                        done unto Jericho and to Ai,</p>
                    <p>4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks
                        upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;</p>
                    <p>5 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of
                        their provision was dry<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mouldy.</p>
                    <p>6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel,
                        We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.</p>
                    <p>7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we
                        make a league with you?</p>
                    <p>8 And they said unto Joshua, We<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy servants.
                        And Joshua said unto them, Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye? and from
                        whence come ye?</p>
                    <p>9 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in
                        Egypt,</p>
                    <p>10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon,
                        and to Og king of Bashan, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at Ashtaroth.
                    </p>
                    <p>11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals
                        with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them,
                        We<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your servants: therefore now make ye a
                        league with us.</p>
                    <p>12 This our bread we took hot<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our provision out
                        of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is
                        mouldy:</p>
                    <p>13 And these bottles of wine, which we
                        filled,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>new; and, behold, they be rent: and
                        these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.</p>
                    <p>14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked
                        not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>counsel</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the mouth of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the
                        princes of the congregation sware unto them.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the end of three days after they
                        had made a league with them, that they heard that
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their neighbours,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they dwelt among them.</p>
                    <p>17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their
                        cities<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and
                        Kirjath-jearim.</p>
                    <p>18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn
                        unto them by the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against
                        the princes.</p>
                    <p>19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.</p>
                    <p>20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the
                        oath which we sware unto them.</p>
                    <p>21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of
                        water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them,
                        saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying,
                        We<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
                    </p>
                    <p>23 Now therefore ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cursed, and there shall none
                        of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my
                        God.</p>
                    <p>24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to
                        destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our
                        lives because of you, and have done this thing.</p>
                    <p>25 And now, behold, we<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in thine hand: as it
                        seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</p>
                    <p>26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that
                        they slew them not.</p>
                    <p>27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and
                        for the altar of the Lord, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and
                        had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her
                        king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</p>
                    <p>2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        great city, as one of the royal cities, and because
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>greater than Ai, and all the men
                        thereof<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mighty.</p>
                    <p>3 Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of
                        Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p>
                    <p>4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and
                        with the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king
                        of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up,
                        they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to
                        Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and
                        help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
                        against us.</p>
                    <p>7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men
                        of valour.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Joshua, Fear them
                        not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
                    </p>
                    <p>9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>went
                        up from Gilgal all night.</p>
                    <p>10 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great
                        slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them
                        to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</p>
                    <p>11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before
                        Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>were in the going down to Beth-horon,
                        that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and
                        they
                        died:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>more
                        which died with hailstones than<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whom the
                        children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then spake Joshua to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                        day when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and
                        he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley
                        of Ajalon.</p>
                    <p>13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon
                        their enemies.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not this written in the book of
                        Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole
                        day.</p>
                    <p>14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>fought
                        for Israel.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the
                        camp to Gilgal.</p>
                    <p>16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</p>
                    <p>17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</p>
                    <p>18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep
                        them:</p>
                    <p>19 And stay ye not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pursue after your enemies,
                        and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath delivered them into your hand.</p>
                    <p>20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them
                        with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the
                        rest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>remained of them entered into fenced
                        cities.</p>
                    <p>21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue
                        against any of the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of
                        the cave.</p>
                    <p>23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of
                        Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of
                        Lachish,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king of Eglon.</p>
                    <p>24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all
                        the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near,
                        put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the
                        necks of them.</p>
                    <p>25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus
                        shall the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</p>
                    <p>26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were
                        hanging upon the trees until the evening.</p>
                    <p>27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the
                        sun,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Joshua commanded, and they took them down
                        off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in
                        the cave&rsquo;s
                        mouth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>remain</em><span>&nbsp;</span>until
                        this very day.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the
                        edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein; he let none remain: and he did
                        to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
                    <p>29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against
                        Libnah:</p>
                    <p>30 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of
                        Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein; he let none remain in it; but
                        did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
                    <p>31<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him,
                        unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
                    <p>32 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the
                        second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein, according to all that he had
                        done to Libnah.</p>
                    <p>33<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and
                        Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</p>
                    <p>34<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel
                        with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
                    <p>35 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein he utterly destroyed that day,
                        according to all that he had done to Lachish.</p>
                    <p>36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against
                        it:</p>
                    <p>37 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the
                        cities thereof, and all the souls
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein; he left none remaining,
                        according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em>therein.</p>
                    <p>38<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir;
                        and fought against it:</p>
                    <p>39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the
                        edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein; he left none remaining: as he
                        had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah,
                        and to her king.</p>
                    <p>40<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
                        south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but
                        utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel commanded.</p>
                    <p>41 And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even
                        unto Gibeon.</p>
                    <p>42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel fought for Israel.</p>
                    <p>43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</p>

                    <p>AND it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had
                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>those</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, that he sent to Jobab
                        king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,</p>

                        Mizpeh.</p>
                    <p>4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the sea shore in multitude, with
                        horses and chariots very many.</p>
                    <p>5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of
                        Merom, to fight against Israel.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Joshua, Be not

                        Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.</p>
                    <p>7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom
                        suddenly; and they fell upon them.</p>
                    <p>8 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and
                        chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward;
                        and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.</p>
                    <p>9 And Joshua did unto them as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>bade him: he houghed their horses, and
                        burnt their chariots with fire.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and
                        smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>11 And they smote all the souls that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein
                        with the edge of the sword, utterly
                        destroying<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there was not any left to breathe:
                        and he burnt Hazor with fire.</p>
                    <p>12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them
                        with the edge of the sword,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he utterly
                        destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded.</p>
                    <p>13 But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the cities
                        that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor
                        only;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>did Joshua burn.</p>
                    <p>14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto
                        themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them,
                        neither left they any to breathe.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>As the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Moses his
                        servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Moses.</p>
                    <p>16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of
                        Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
                    </p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir,
                        even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and
                        smote them, and slew them.</p>
                    <p>18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</p>
                    <p>19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the
                        inhabitants of Gibeon: all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they took in
                        battle.</p>
                    <p>20 For it was of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to harden their hearts, that they should come against
                        Israel in battle, that he might destroy them
                        utterly,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that they might have no favour, but
                        that he might destroy them, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Moses.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims
                        from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and
                        from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</p>
                    <p>22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in
                        Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</p>
                    <p>23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto
                        Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their
                        tribes. And the land rested from war.</p>

                    <p>2 By lot<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their inheritance, as the

                    <p>3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan:
                        but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.</p>
                    <p>4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part

                        suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.</p>
                    <p>5 As the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided

                    <p>8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly

                    <p>9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be
                        thine inheritance, and thy children&rsquo;s for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the

                        this day as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                        day that Moses sent me: as my strength<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>then,
                        even so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my strength now, for war, both to go
                        out, and to come in.</p>
                    <p>12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake in that day; for
                        thou heardest in that day how the
                        Anakims<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        cities<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fenced:
                        if so be the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with me,
                        then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said.</p>
                    <p>13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
                    </p>
                    <p>14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this
                        day, because that he wholly followed the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel.</p>
                    <p>15 And the name of Hebron
                        before<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Kirjath-arba;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Arba</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.</p>

                        of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children
                        of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children
                        of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida:
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the male children of Manasseh the son of
                        Joseph by their families.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the
                        son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and
                        Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</p>
                    <p>4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the
                        princes, saying, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
                        brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>he gave them an
                        inheritance among the brethren of their father.</p>
                    <p>5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the other side Jordan;</p>
                    <p>6 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of
                        Manasseh&rsquo;s sons had the land of Gilead.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lieth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before Shechem; and the border went
                        along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Now</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah
                        on the border of Manasseh<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belonged</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the children
                        of Ephraim;</p>
                    <p>9 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of
                        Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among the cities of Manasseh: the coast
                        of Manasseh also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the north side of the
                        river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:</p>
                    <p>10
                        Southward<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ephraim&rsquo;s,
                        and
                        northward<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Manasseh&rsquo;s,
                        and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the
                        east.</p>
                    <p>11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns,
                        and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the
                        inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
                        towns,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>three countries.</p>
                    <p>12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive
                        out<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>inhabitants</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>those
                        cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</p>
                    <p>13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the
                        Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.</p>
                    <p>14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given
                        me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great people, forasmuch as the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath blessed me hitherto?</p>
                    <p>15 And Joshua answered them, If thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great
                        people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>get thee up to the

                        Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</p>
                    <p>16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that
                        dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of
                        iron,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>both</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        Beth-shean and her towns,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        the valley of Jezreel.</p>
                    <p>17 And Joshua spake unto the house of
                        Joseph,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying,
                        Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great people, and hast great power: thou
                        shalt not have one lot<span>&nbsp;</span><em>only:</em></p>
                    <p>18 But the mountain shall be thine; for it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive
                        out the Canaanites, though they have iron
                        chariots,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>though

                    <p>AND the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the
                        tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.</p>
                    <p>2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their
                        inheritance.</p>
                    <p>3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How

                    <p>4 Give out from among you three men for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>each</em><span>&nbsp;</span>tribe:
                        and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to
                        the inheritance of them; and they shall
                        come<span>&nbsp;</span><em>again</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to me.</p>
                    <p>5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and
                        the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.</p>
                    <p>6 Ye shall therefore describe the land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>into</em><span>&nbsp;</span>seven

                    <p>7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and
                        half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which

                    <p>9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a
                        book, and came<span>&nbsp;</span><em>again</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Joshua to the host at

                    <p>17 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over against the going up of Adummim, and

                        asked,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he
                        built the city, and dwelt therein.</p>
                    <p>51 These<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the inheritances, which Eleazar the
                        priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
                        Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the Lord, at the door of the

                        unto you by the hand of Moses:</p>
                    <p>3 That the slayer that killeth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>person

                        him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.</p>
                    <p>5 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into
                        his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.</p>
                    <p>6 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for

                        cities.</p>
                    <p>33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their
                        families<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thirteen cities with their suburbs.
                    </p>
                    <p>34<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest
                        of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her
                        suburbs,</p>
                    <p>35 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.</p>
                    <p>36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,</p>
                    <p>37 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.</p>
                    <p>38 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
                        suburbs,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a city of

                    <p>40 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the
                        families of the Levites, were<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their lot twelve
                        cities.</p>
                    <p>41 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of
                        Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forty and eight cities with their
                        suburbs.</p>
                    <p>42 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
                        thus<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all these cities.</p>
                    <p>43<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>gave unto Israel all the
                        land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.</p>
                    <p>44 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto
                        their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered all their enemies into their hand.</p>
                    <p>45 There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had spoken unto the
                        house of Israel; all came to pass.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THEN Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,</p>
                    <p>2 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:</p>
                    <p>3 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the
                        commandment of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God.</p>
                    <p>4 And now the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised
                        them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your
                        tents,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto the land of your possession, which
                        Moses the servant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>gave you on the other side Jordan.</p>
                    <p>5 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>charged you, to love the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, and to walk in
                        all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all
                        your heart and with all your soul.</p>
                    <p>6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now to
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had
                        given<span>&nbsp;</span><em>possession</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Bashan: but unto
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>half thereof gave Joshua among their
                        brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents,
                        then he blessed them,</p>
                    <p>8 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much
                        cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment:
                        divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
                        half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of Canaan, to go unto the
                        country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to
                        the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>by the hand of Moses.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when they came unto the borders of Jordan,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of Canaan, the children of
                        Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a
                        great altar to see to.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the
                        children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar
                        over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>12 And when the children of Israel
                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, the whole congregation of the
                        children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</p>
                    <p>13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and
                        to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
                    </p>
                    <p>14 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel;
                        and each one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an head of the house of their
                        fathers among the thousands of Israel.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the
                        children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with
                        them, saying,</p>
                    <p>16 Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord, What
                        trespass<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this that ye have committed against the
                        God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the Lord, in that ye have builded you an
                        altar, that ye might rebel this day against the Lord?</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from
                        which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the
                        Lord,</p>
                    <p>18 But that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord? and it will
                        be,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>seeing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye rebel to day against the Lord, that
                        to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.</p>
                    <p>19 Notwithstanding, if the land of your
                        possession<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unclean,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pass
                        ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein the Lord&rsquo;s tabernacle
                        dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the Lord, nor rebel against us, in
                        building you an altar beside the altar of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God.</p>
                    <p>20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all
                        the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
                        the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</p>
                    <p>22 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of gods, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of gods, he knoweth,
                        and Israel he shall know;
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in rebellion,
                        or if in transgression against the Lord, (save us not this day,)</p>
                    <p>23 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord, or if to offer thereon burnt
                        offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>himself require<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it;</em></p>
                    <p>24 And if we have not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>rather</em><span>&nbsp;</span>done it for fear
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thing, saying, In time to come your
                        children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel?</p>
                    <p>25 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of
                        Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the Lord: so shall your children make our
                        children cease from fearing the Lord.</p>
                    <p>26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for
                        sacrifice:</p>
                    <p>27
                        But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>may</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with
                        our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no
                        part in the Lord.</p>
                    <p>28 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they
                        should<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>say to us or to our generations in time
                        to come, that we may say<span>&nbsp;</span><em>again</em>, Behold the pattern of the altar of
                        the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a witness between us and you.</p>
                    <p>29 God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day from following the Lord,
                        to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar
                        of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before his tabernacle.</p>
                    <p>30<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the

                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, heard the words that the
                        children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.
                    </p>
                    <p>31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the
                        children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among us, because ye have not committed
                        this trespass against the Lord: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of
                        the Lord.</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the
                        princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of
                        Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</p>
                    <p>33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did
                        not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben
                        and Gad dwelt.</p>
                    <p>34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
                        altar<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Ed:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a witness
                        between us that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God.</p>

                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>you, no man
                        hath been able to stand before you unto this day.</p>
                    <p>10 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God,
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that fighteth
                        for you, as he hath promised you.</p>
                    <p>11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God.
                    </p>
                    <p>12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these
                        nations,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>these that remain among you, and
                        shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:</p>
                    <p>13 Know for a certainty that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God will no more drive
                        out<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>these nations
                        from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and
                        thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the Lordyour God hath given
                        you.</p>
                    <p>14 And, behold, this day I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>going the way of all
                        the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed
                        of all the good things which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God spake concerning you; all are
                        come to pass unto you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not one thing hath
                        failed thereof.</p>
                    <p>15 Therefore it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as all good
                        things are come upon you, which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God promised you; so shall the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this
                        good land which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God hath given you.</p>
                    <p>16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, which he
                        commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the
                        anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
                        the good land which he hath given unto you.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and
                        for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves
                        before God.</p>
                    <p>2 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, Your
                        fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old
                        time,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Terah, the father of Abraham, and the
                        father of Nachor: and they served other gods.</p>
                    <p>3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the
                        land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.</p>
                    <p>4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob
                        and his children went down into Egypt.</p>
                    <p>5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and
                        afterward I brought you out.</p>
                    <p>6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued
                        after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.</p>
                    <p>7 And when they cried unto the Lord, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought
                        the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye
                        dwelt in the wilderness a long season.</p>
                    <p>8 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they
                        fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
                        destroyed them from before you.</p>
                    <p>9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and
                        called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:</p>
                    <p>10 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of
                        his hand.</p>
                    <p>11 And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the
                        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the
                        Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.</p>
                    <p>12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before
                        you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the two kings of the
                        Amorites;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye
                        dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity
                        and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood,
                        and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.</p>
                    <p>15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve;
                        whether the gods which your fathers served
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the other side of the flood, or the
                        gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the
                        Lord.</p>
                    <p>16 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord, to serve other
                        gods;</p>
                    <p>17 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God,
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that brought us
                        up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those
                        great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the
                        people through whom we passed:</p>
                    <p>18 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites
                        which dwelt in the land:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>therefore</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will we also
                        serve the Lord; for he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our God.</p>
                    <p>19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord: for
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an holy God;
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a jealous God; he will not forgive your
                        transgressions nor your sins.</p>
                    <p>20 If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume
                        you, after that he hath done you good.</p>
                    <p>21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the Lord.</p>
                    <p>22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witnesses
                        against yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord, to serve him. And they
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>We</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witnesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>23 Now therefore put away,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>said</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em>, the
                        strange gods which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among you, and incline your
                        heart unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel.</p>
                    <p>24 And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God will we serve, and his
                        voice will we obey.</p>
                    <p>25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in
                        Shechem.</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of
                        God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the sanctuary of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it
                        hath heard all the words of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>which he spake unto us: it shall be
                        therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</p>
                    <p>28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</p>
                    <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the
                        son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                        hundred and ten years old.</p>
                    <p>30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the
                        hill of Gaash.</p>
                    <p>31 And Israel served the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the
                        elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the Lord, that he had done
                        for Israel.</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel
                        brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the
                        sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the
                        inheritance of the children of Joseph.</p>
                    <p>33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
                        hill<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>pertained</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Phinehas
                        his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</p>
