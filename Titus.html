                    <p>PAUL, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God&rsquo;s
                        elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
                    <p>2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world
                        began<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me
                        according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
                    <p>4 To Titus,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>mine</em><span>&nbsp;</span>own son after the common faith:
                        Grace, mercy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>peace, from God the Father and
                        the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
                    <p>5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are
                        wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
                    <p>6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or
                        unruly.</p>
                    <p>7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not
                        given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
                    <p>8 But<span>&nbsp;</span><span>a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober</span>, just,
                        holy, temperate;</p>
                    <p>9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine
                        both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
                    <p>10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and
                        deceivers,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>specially</span><span>&nbsp;</span>they of the circumcision:
                    </p>
                    <p>11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not,
                        for filthy lucre&rsquo;s sake.</p>
                    <p>12 One of themselves,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a prophet of their own,
                        said, The Cretians<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>alway liars, evil beasts,
                        slow bellies.</p>
                    <p>13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the
                        faith<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
                    <p>15 Unto the pure all things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pure: but unto them
                        that are defiled and unbelieving<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing pure;
                        but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
                    <p>16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, being
                        abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
