                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a
                        certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and
                        his two sons.</p>
                    <p>2 And the name of the man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Elimelech, and the
                        name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
                        Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</p>
                    <p>3 And Elimelech Naomi&rsquo;s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</p>
                    <p>4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and
                        they dwelled there about ten years.</p>
                    <p>5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her
                        husband.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
                        return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had visited his people in giving them bread.</p>
                    <p>7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her;
                        and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</p>
                    <p>8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother&rsquo;s house: the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</p>
                    <p>9 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>grant you that ye may find rest,
                        each<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the house
                        of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</p>
                    <p>10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.</p>
                    <p>11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
                        me?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there
                        yet<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>more</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sons in my
                        womb, that they may be your husbands?</p>
                    <p>12 Turn again, my daughters,
                        go<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>way;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for I am
                        too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have
                        hope,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I should have an husband also to night,
                        and should also bear sons;</p>
                    <p>13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands?
                        nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>is gone out against me.</p>
                    <p>14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth
                        clave unto her.</p>
                    <p>15 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods:
                        return thou after thy sister in law.</p>
                    <p>16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave
                        thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to return from following after thee: for
                        whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        people, and thy God my God:</p>
                    <p>17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>do so to
                        me, and more
                        also,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ought</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but death
                        part thee and me.</p>
                    <p>18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
                    </p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it
                        came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and
                        they said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this Naomi?</p>
                    <p>20 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very
                        bitterly with me.</p>
                    <p>21 I went out full, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath brought me home again empty:
                        why<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>call ye me Naomi, seeing the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</p>
                    <p>22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out
                        of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND Naomi had a kinsman of her husband&rsquo;s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of
                        Elimelech; and his name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Boaz.</p>
                    <p>2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn
                        after<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in whose sight I shall find grace. And
                        she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</p>
                    <p>3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on
                        a part of the field<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belonging</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto Boaz,
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the
                        reapers, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you. And they answered
                        him, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>bless thee.</p>
                    <p>5 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose
                        damsel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this?</p>
                    <p>6 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said,
                        It<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Moabitish damsel that came back with
                        Naomi out of the country of Moab:</p>
                    <p>7 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she
                        came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field,
                        neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine
                        eyes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the field that they do reap, and go thou
                        after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art
                        athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which the young men have drawn.</p>
                    <p>10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I
                        found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a stranger?</p>
                    <p>11 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done
                        unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast left thy father and thy mother,
                        and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p>
                    <p>12 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</p>
                    <p>13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and
                        for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine
                        handmaidens.</p>
                    <p>14 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel
                        in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her
                        parched<span>&nbsp;</span><em>corn</em>, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</p>
                    <p>15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even
                        among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</p>
                    <p>16 And let fall also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the handfuls of purpose
                        for her, and leave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, that she may
                        glean<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, and rebuke her not.</p>
                    <p>17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an
                        ephah of barley.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And she
                        took<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up, and went into the city: and her mother
                        in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved
                        after she was sufficed.</p>
                    <p>19 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest
                        thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
                        she had wrought, and said, The man&rsquo;s name with whom I wrought to
                        day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Boaz.</p>
                    <p>20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law,
                        Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he of the Lord, who hath not left off
                        his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near of kin unto us, one of our next
                        kinsmen.</p>
                    <p>21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until
                        they have ended all my harvest.</p>
                    <p>22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in
                        law,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good, my
                        daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</p>
                    <p>23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat
                        harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THEN Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it
                        may be well with thee?</p>
                    <p>2 And now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not Boaz of our kindred, with whose
                        maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</p>
                    <p>3 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to

                    <p>4 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and
                        thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt
                        do.</p>
                    <p>5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
                        that her mother in law bade her.</p>
                    <p>7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of
                        the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid,

                    <p>12 And now it is true that
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near kinsman:
                        howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</p>
                    <p>13 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the
                        morning,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>if he will perform unto thee the part
                        of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman&rsquo;s part: but if he will not do the part of a
                        kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to
                        thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth: lie
                        down until the morning.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose
                        up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the
                        floor.</p>
                    <p>15 Also he said, Bring the vail
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>hast</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon
                        thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured
                        six<span>&nbsp;</span><em>measures</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of barley, and
                        laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on her: and she went into the city.</p>
                    <p>16 And when she came to her mother in law, she said,
                        Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou, my daughter? And she told her all
                        that the man had done to her.</p>
                    <p>17 And she said, These six<span>&nbsp;</span><em>measures</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of barley gave
                        he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</p>
                    <p>18 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man
                        will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</p>

                    <h1>The Book of Ruth<br /><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ruth+4&version=NIV"

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THEN went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz
                        spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
                        aside, and sat down.</p>
                    <p>2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
                    </p>
                    <p>3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a
                        parcel of land, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our brother
                        Elimelech&rsquo;s:</p>
                    <p>4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying,
                        Buy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before the inhabitants, and before the
                        elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>,
                        redeem<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but if thou wilt not
                        redeem<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>tell me,
                        that I may know:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none to
                        redeem<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beside thee; and
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>after thee. And he said, I will
                        redeem<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must
                        buy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the
                        dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the kinsman said, I cannot
                        redeem<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for myself, lest I mar mine own
                        inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>7 Now
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>manner</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a
                        man plucked off his shoe, and gave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his
                        neighbour: and this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a testimony in Israel.</p>
                    <p>8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for
                        thee. So he drew off his shoe.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Boaz said unto the elders,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the people,
                        Ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witnesses this day, that I have bought all
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Elimelech&rsquo;s, and all
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Chilion&rsquo;s and Mahlon&rsquo;s, of the
                        hand of Naomi.</p>
                    <p>10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up
                        the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among
                        his brethren, and from the gate of his place:
                        ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witnesses this day.</p>
                    <p>11 And all the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the gate, and the
                        elders,
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>We</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witnesses.
                        The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like
                        Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous
                        in Beth-lehem:</p>
                    <p>12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall give thee of this young woman.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went
                        in unto her, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>gave her conception, and she bare a son.</p>
                    <p>14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>life,
                        and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to
                        thee than seven sons, hath born him.</p>
                    <p>16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</p>
                    <p>17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they
                        called his name Obed: he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the father of Jesse,
                        the father of David.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat
                        Hezron,</p>
                    <p>19 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</p>
                    <p>20 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>
                    <p>21 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</p>
                    <p>22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</p>
