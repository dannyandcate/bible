                    <p>PETER, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
                        Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</p>
                    <p>2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit,
                        unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be
                        multiplied.</p>
                    <p>3 Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the
                        resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</p>
                    <p>4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
                        for you,</p>
                    <p>5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last
                        time.</p>
                    <p>6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through
                        manifold temptations:</p>
                    <p>7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it
                        be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus
                        Christ:</p>
                    <p>8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye
                        see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
                        unspeakable and full of glory:</p>
                    <p>9 Receiving the end of your faith,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        salvation of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>souls.</p>
                    <p>10 Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the
                        grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>should</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>come</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                        you:</p>
                    <p>11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify,
                        when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</p>
                    <p>12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things,
                        which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy
                        Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</p>
                    <p>13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is
                        to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</p>
                    <p>14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your
                        ignorance:</p>
                    <p>15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p>
                    <p>16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
                    <p>17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every
                        man&rsquo;s work, pass the time of your
                        sojourning<span>&nbsp;</span><em>here</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in fear:</p>
                    <p>18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
                        things,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>silver and gold, from your vain
                        conversation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>received</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by tradition from your
                        fathers;</p>
                    <p>19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</p>
                    <p>20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last
                        times for you,</p>
                    <p>21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your
                        faith and hope might be in God.</p>
                    <p>22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love
                        of the
                        brethren,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>see</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span>love
                        one another with a pure heart fervently:</p>
                    <p>23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
                        liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
                    <p>24 For all flesh<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as grass, and all the glory of
                        man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p>
                    <p>25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is
                        preached unto you.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>WHEREFORE laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil
                        speakings,</p>
                    <p>2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p>
                    <p>3 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gracious.
                    </p>
                    <p>4 To whom
                        coming,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a living
                        stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of
                        God,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>precious,</p>
                    <p>5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up
                        spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone,
                        elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>
                    <p>7 Unto you therefore which
                        believe<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>precious:
                        but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made
                        the head of the corner,</p>
                    <p>8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of
                        offence,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which
                        stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
                    <p>9 But ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a chosen generation, a royal
                        priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who
                        hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
                    <p>10 Which in time past<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a people,
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>now the people of God: which had not
                        obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
                    <p>11 Dearly beloved, I beseech<span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as strangers and
                        pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p>
                    <p>12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as
                        evildoers, they may by<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good works, which they
                        shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
                    <p>13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord&rsquo;s sake: whether it be to the
                        king, as supreme;</p>
                    <p>14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for
                        the praise of them that do well.</p>
                    <p>15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish
                        men:</p>
                    <p>16 As free, and not using<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>liberty for a cloke
                        of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>
                    <p>17 Honour all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
                    </p>
                    <p>18 Servants,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>subject
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>masters with all fear; not only to the good
                        and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
                    <p>19 For this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thankworthy, if a man for conscience
                        toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</p>
                    <p>20 For what glory<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, if, when ye be
                        buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
                        suffer<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, ye take it patiently,
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>acceptable with God.</p>
                    <p>21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
                        that ye should follow his steps:</p>
                    <p>22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</p>
                    <p>23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but
                        committed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>himself</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to him that judgeth righteously:
                    </p>
                    <p>24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,
                        should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p>
                    <p>25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your
                        souls.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>LIKEWISE, ye wives,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in subjection to your own
                        husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the
                        conversation of the wives;</p>
                    <p>2 While they behold your chaste
                        conversation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>coupled</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with fear.</p>
                    <p>3 Whose adorning let it not be that
                        outward<span>&nbsp;</span><em>adorning</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of plaiting the hair, and of
                        wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
                    <p>4 But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
                        corruptible,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ornament</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
                    <p>5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned
                        themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</p>
                    <p>6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well,
                        and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
                    <p>7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>according
                        to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs
                        together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
                    <p>8 Finally,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all of
                        one mind, having compassion one of another, love as
                        brethren,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pitiful,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>courteous:
                    </p>
                    <p>9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye
                        are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
                    <p>10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his
                        lips that they speak no guile:</p>
                    <p>11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
                    <p>12 For the eyes of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over the righteous,
                        and his
                        ears<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>open</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto their

                        that do evil.</p>
                    <p>13 And who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that will harm you, if ye be
                        followers of that which is good?</p>
                    <p>14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness&rsquo; sake,
                        happy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and be not
                        afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</p>
                    <p>15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ready always
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>give</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an answer to every man that asketh you a
                        reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</p>
                    <p>16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be
                        ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
                    <p>17 For<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better, if
                        the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</p>
                    <p>18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us
                        to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
                    <p>19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
                    <p>20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of
                        Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
                    <p>21 The like figure whereunto<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>baptism doth also
                        now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
                        toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>
                    <p>22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers
                        being made subject unto him.</p>

                    <p>FORASMUCH then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same
                        mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</p>
                    <p>2 That he no longer should live the rest of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>time
                        in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
                    <p>3 For the time past of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>our</em><span>&nbsp;</span>life may suffice us to
                        have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine,
                        revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>
                    <p>4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the same excess of riot, speaking evil
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>you:</em></p>
                    <p>5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
                    <p>6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be
                        judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
                    <p>7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</p>
                    <p>8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the
                        multitude of sins.</p>
                    <p>9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</p>
                    <p>10 As every man hath received the
                        gift,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>minister
                        the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
                    <p>11 If any man
                        speak,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>speak</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        the oracles of God; if any man
                        minister,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
                        to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
                    <p>12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some
                        strange thing happened unto you:</p>
                    <p>13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings; that, when his glory
                        shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
                    <p>14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ,
                        happy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for the
                        spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your
                        part he is glorified.</p>
                    <p>15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        thief, or<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an evildoer, or as a busybody in other
                        men&rsquo;s matters.</p>
                    <p>16 Yet
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>suffer</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</p>
                    <p>17 For the
                        time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>come</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        judgment must begin at the house of God: and
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>first<span>&nbsp;</span><em>begin</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at
                        us, what shall the end<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of them that obey not the
                        gospel of God?</p>
                    <p>18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
                    <p>19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their
                        souls<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in well
                        doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>

                    <p>THE elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of
                        Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
                    <p>2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the
                        oversight<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thereof</em>, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
                        lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
                    <p>3 Neither as being lords
                        over<span>&nbsp;</span><em>God</em>&rsquo;<em>s</em><span>&nbsp;</span>heritage, but being
                        ensamples to the flock.</p>
                    <p>4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not
                        away.</p>
                    <p>5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be subject
                        one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to
                        the humble.</p>
                    <p>6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
                    </p>
                    <p>7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
                    <p>8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about,
                        seeking whom he may devour:</p>
                    <p>9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your
                        brethren that are in the world.</p>
                    <p>10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after
                        that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen,
                        settle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em>.</p>
                    <p>11 To him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory and dominion for ever and ever.
                        Amen.</p>
                    <p>12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and
                        testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>
                    <p>13

                        son.</p>
