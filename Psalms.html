                    <p>2 But his delight<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the law of the Lord; and in
                        his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>

                    <p>WHY do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>

                        and against his anointed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>,</p>
                    <p>3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
                    <p>4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.</p>
                    <p>5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>
                    <p>6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
                    <p>7 I will declare the decree: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath said unto me,
                        Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
                    <p>8 Ask of me, and I shall give<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        heathen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine inheritance, and the uttermost

                    <p>10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>
                    <p>11 Serve the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
                    <p>12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye
                        perish<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the way, when his wrath is kindled but

                        drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</p>
                    <p>5 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the portion of mine inheritance and of
                        my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</p>
                    <p>6 The lines are fallen unto me in
                        pleasant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>places;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yea, I have a goodly heritage.</p>
                    <p>7 I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night
                        seasons.</p>
                    <p>8 I have set the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>always before me:
                        because<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at my
                        right hand, I shall not be moved.</p>
                    <p>9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>
                    <p>10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
                        corruption.</p>
                    <p>11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy
                        presence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fulness of joy; at thy right
                        hand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pleasures

                    <p>To the chief
                        Musician,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>A</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Psalm</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        David, the servant of the Lord, who spake unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>the words of this song
                        in the day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of
                        Saul: And he said,</p>
                    <p>I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength.</p>
                    <p>2 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my rock, and my fortress, and my
                        deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
                        salvation,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my high tower.</p>
                    <p>3 I will call upon the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>who</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>worthy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
                    <p>4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
                    <p>5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
                    <p>6 In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his
                        temple, and my cry came before him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into his
                        ears.</p>
                    <p>7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken,
                        because he was wroth.</p>
                    <p>8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were
                        kindled by it.</p>
                    <p>9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and
                        darkness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under his feet.</p>
                    <p>10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
                    <p>11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dark
                        waters<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thick clouds of the skies.</p>
                    <p>12 At the
                        brightness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before
                        him his thick clouds passed, hail<span>&nbsp;</span><em>stones</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and coals
                        of fire.</p>
                    <p>13 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice;
                        hail<span>&nbsp;</span><em>stones</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and coals of fire.</p>
                    <p>14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited
                        them.</p>
                    <p>15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy
                        rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
                    <p>16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
                    <p>17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong
                        for me.</p>
                    <p>18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was my stay.</p>
                    <p>19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
                    <p>20 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
                        cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
                    <p>21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
                    <p>22 For all his judgments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before me, and I did
                        not put away his statutes from me.</p>
                    <p>23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
                    <p>24 Therefore hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>recompensed me according to my righteousness,
                        according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
                    <p>25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself
                        upright;</p>
                    <p>26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself
                        froward.</p>
                    <p>27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
                    <p>28 For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>my God will enlighten my darkness.
                    </p>
                    <p>29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
                    <p>30<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God, his
                        way<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>perfect: the word of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>is tried: he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a buckler to
                        all those that trust in him.</p>
                    <p>31 For who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God save the Lord? or
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a rock save our God?</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God that girdeth
                        me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
                    <p>33 He maketh my feet like hinds&rsquo;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>feet</em>, and setteth me upon my
                        high places.</p>
                    <p>34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
                    <p>35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and
                        thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
                    <p>36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
                    <p>37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were
                        consumed.</p>
                    <p>38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
                    <p>39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that
                        rose up against me.</p>
                    <p>40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
                    <p>41 They cried,
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none to
                        save<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto the
                        Lord, but he answered them not.</p>
                    <p>42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the
                        streets.</p>
                    <p>43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the
                        people;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast made me the head of the
                        heathen: a people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>whom</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have not known shall serve
                        me.</p>
                    <p>44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
                    </p>
                    <p>45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
                    <p>46 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth; and
                        blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my rock; and let the God of my salvation
                        be exalted.</p>
                    <p>47<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God that
                        avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
                    <p>48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against
                        me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
                    <p>49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy
                        name.</p>
                    <p>50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to
                        his seed for evermore.</p>

                    <p>7 The law of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>perfect, converting the

                    <p>9 The fear of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>clean, enduring for ever:
                        the judgments of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>true<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>righteous

                        gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
                    <p>11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in

                        reward.</p>
                    <p>12 Who can understand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>errors? cleanse thou me
                        from secret<span>&nbsp;</span><em>faults</em>.</p>
                    <p>13 Keep back thy servant also from
                        presumptuous<span>&nbsp;</span><em>sins;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>let them not have dominion over
                        me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</p>
                    <p>14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord,
                        my strength, and my redeemer.</p>

                    <p>21 Save me from the lion&rsquo;s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.

                    <p>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.</p>
                    <p>IN thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.</p>
                    <p>2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence
                        to save me.</p>
                    <p>3 For thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my rock and my fortress; therefore
                        for thy name&rsquo;s sake lead me, and guide me.</p>
                    <p>4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my strength.</p>
                    <p>5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of
                        truth.</p>
                    <p>6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the Lord.</p>
                    <p>7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known
                        my soul in adversities;</p>
                    <p>8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</p>
                    <p>9 Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with
                        grief,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yea</em>, my soul and my belly.</p>
                    <p>10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of
                        mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</p>
                    <p>11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to
                        mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</p>
                    <p>12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</p>
                    <p>13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on
                        every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</p>
                    <p>14 But I trusted in thee, O Lord: I said,
                        Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my God.</p>
                    <p>15 My times<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in thy hand: deliver me from the
                        hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</p>
                    <p>16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies&rsquo; sake.</p>
                    <p>17 Let me not be ashamed, O Lord; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be
                        ashamed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>let them be silent in the grave.</p>
                    <p>18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously
                        against the righteous.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Oh</em><span>&nbsp;</span>how
                        great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for
                        them that fear thee;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast wrought for
                        them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</p>
                    <p>20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them
                        secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p>
                    <p>21 Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord: for he hath shewed me his
                        marvellous kindness in a strong city.</p>
                    <p>22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the
                        voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</p>
                    <p>23 O love the Lord, all ye his saints:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</p>
                    <p>24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord.</p>

                    <p><em>A</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Psalm</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of David.</p>
                    <p>PLEAD<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>cause</em>, O Lord, with them that
                        strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.</p>
                    <p>2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</p>
                    <p>3 Draw out also the spear, and
                        stop<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>way</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against
                        them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        salvation.</p>
                    <p>4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and
                        brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</p>
                    <p>5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>chase<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>persecute
                        them.</p>
                    <p>7 For without cause have they hid for me their
                        net<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        pit,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>without cause they have digged for my
                        soul.</p>
                    <p>8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into
                        that very destruction let him fall.</p>
                    <p>9 And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</p>
                    <p>10 All my bones shall say, Lord, who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like unto
                        thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy
                        from him that spoileth him?</p>
                    <p>11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my
                        charge<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that I knew not.</p>
                    <p>12 They rewarded me evil for good<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the spoiling of
                        my soul.</p>
                    <p>13 But as for me, when they were sick, my
                        clothing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sackcloth: I humbled my soul with
                        fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</p>
                    <p>14 I behaved myself as
                        though<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        friend<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brother: I bowed down heavily, as one
                        that
                        mourneth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
                        together:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yea</em>, the abjects gathered themselves together against me,
                        and I knew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not; they did
                        tear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em>, and ceased not:</p>
                    <p>16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>
                    <p>17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the
                        lions.</p>
                    <p>18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</p>
                    <p>19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over
                        me:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neither</em><span>&nbsp;</span>let them wink with the eye that hate me
                        without a cause.</p>
                    <p>20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
                        against<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>quiet
                        in the land.</p>
                    <p>21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against
                        me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>said, Aha, aha, our eye hath
                        seen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><em>This</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast seen, O Lord: keep not silence: O
                        Lord, be not far from me.</p>
                    <p>23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my
                        judgment,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>24 Judge me, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not
                        rejoice over me.</p>
                    <p>25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed
                        him up.</p>
                    <p>26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be
                        clothed with shame and dishonour that
                        magnify<span>&nbsp;</span><em>themselves</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against me.</p>
                    <p>27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say
                        continually, Let the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity
                        of his servant.</p>
                    <p>28 And my tongue shall speak of thy
                        righteousness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of thy praise all the day long.
                    </p>

                        David the servant of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>THE transgression of the wicked saith within my
                        heart,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        fear of God before his eyes.</p>
                    <p>2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</p>
                    <p>3 The words of his mouth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>iniquity and deceit: he
                        hath left off to be wise,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to do good.</p>
                    <p>4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a
                        way<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not good; he

                    <p>6 Thy righteousness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like the great mountains; thy
                        judgments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a great deep: O Lord, thou preservest
                        man and beast.</p>
                    <p>7 How excellent<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy lovingkindness, O God!

                        drink of the river of thy pleasures.</p>
                    <p>9 For with thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the fountain of life: in thy

                        in heart.</p>

                    <p>14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and

                    <p>28 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are

                    <p>34 Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the

                    <p>35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</p>
                    <p>36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not: yea, I
                        sought him, but he could not be found.</p>
                    <p>37 Mark the perfect<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em>, and behold the upright: for the end
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
                    <p>39 But the salvation of the righteous<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                        Lord:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their

                    <p>A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.</p>
                    <p>O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
                    <p>2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no soundness
                        in my flesh because of thine anger;
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rest
                        in my bones because of my sin.</p>
                    <p>4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</p>
                    <p>5 My wounds stink<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are corrupt because of my
                        foolishness.</p>
                    <p>6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</p>
                    <p>7 For my loins are filled with a
                        loathsome<span>&nbsp;</span><em>disease:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        soundness in my flesh.</p>
                    <p>8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</p>
                    <p>9 Lord, all my desire<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before thee; and my
                        groaning is not hid from thee.</p>
                    <p>10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from
                        me.</p>
                    <p>11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>
                    <p>12 They also that seek after my life lay
                        snares<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>me:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and they
                        that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</p>
                    <p>13 But I, as a deaf<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em>, heard not;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as a dumb
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>openeth not his mouth.</p>
                    <p>14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose
                        mouth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no reproofs.</p>
                    <p>15 For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</p>
                    <p>16 For I said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Hear</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em>,
                        lest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>otherwise</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they should rejoice over me: when my
                        foot slippeth, they magnify<span>&nbsp;</span><em>themselves</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against me.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 For I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ready to halt, and my
                        sorrow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>continually before me.</p>
                    <p>18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</p>
                    <p>19 But mine
                        enemies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lively,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they
                        are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>
                    <p>20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I
                        follow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>21 Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not far from me.</p>
                    <p>22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</p>

                        David.</p>
                    <p>I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a
                        bridle, while the wicked is before me.</p>
                    <p>2 I was dumb with silence, I held my
                        peace,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
                    </p>
                    <p>3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire

                    <p>4 Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what

                    <p>I WAITED patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</p>
                    <p>2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a
                        rock,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>established my goings.</p>

                        Corrupt are they, and have done abominable

                    <p>4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my

                        encampeth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>against</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thee: thou hast

                    <p>8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</p>

                    <p>8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.

                    <p>To the chief Musician upon
                        Shoshannim,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>A</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Psalm</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        David.</p>
                    <p>SAVE me, O God; for the waters are come in
                        unto<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>soul.</p>
                    <p>2 I sink in deep mire,
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>
                    <p>3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
                    <p>4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy
                        me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then
                        I restored<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which I took not away.</p>
                    <p>5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</p>
                    <p>6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, be ashamed for my sake:
                        let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>
                    <p>7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
                    <p>8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother&rsquo;s children.</p>
                    <p>9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee
                        are fallen upon me.</p>
                    <p>10 When I
                        wept,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>chastened</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
                    <p>11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
                    <p>12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the song of the drunkards.</p>
                    <p>13 But as for me, my prayer<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto thee, O
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an acceptable time: O God, in the
                        multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
                    <p>14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me,
                        and out of the deep waters.</p>
                    <p>15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit
                        shut her mouth upon me.</p>
                    <p>16 Hear me, O Lord; for thy lovingkindness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good:
                        turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
                    <p>17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
                    <p>18 Draw nigh unto my soul,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>redeem it: deliver me
                        because of mine enemies.</p>
                    <p>19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine
                        adversaries<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all before thee.</p>
                    <p>20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I
                        looked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to take
                        pity,
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none; and
                        for comforters, but I found none.</p>
                    <p>21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
                    <p>22 Let their table become a snare before them:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>should</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>welfare,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>become</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        trap.</p>
                    <p>23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
                    <p>24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
                    <p>25 Let their habitation be desolate;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>let none
                        dwell in their tents.</p>
                    <p>26 For they persecute<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whom thou hast smitten;
                        and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
                    <p>27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>
                    <p>28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
                    <p>29 But I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O
                        God, set me up on high.</p>
                    <p>30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
                    <p>31<span>&nbsp;</span><em>This</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also shall please the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>better than an ox<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bullock
                        that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
                    <p>32 The humble shall
                        see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be glad:
                        and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
                    <p>33 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
                    <p>34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
                    <p>35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and
                        have it in possession.</p>
                    <p>36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell
                        therein.</p>

                    <p>13 Let them be confounded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>consumed that are
                        adversaries to my soul; let them be
                        covered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>reproach and dishonour that seek my
                        hurt.</p>
                    <p>14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</p>
                    <p>15 My mouth shall shew forth thy
                        righteousness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy salvation all the day; for I
                        know not the numbers<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thereof</em>.</p>
                    <p>16 I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy
                        righteousness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of thine only.</p>
                    <p>17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</p>
                    <p>18 Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength
                        unto<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>generation,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        power to every one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is to come.</p>
                    <p>19 Thy righteousness also, O God,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very high, who
                        hast done great things: O God, who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like unto
                        thee!</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Thou</em>, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken
                        me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</p>
                    <p>21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</p>
                    <p>22 I will also praise thee with the
                        psaltery,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy truth, O my God: unto thee will
                        I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</p>
                    <p>23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
                    </p>
                    <p>24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for
                        they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</p>

                    <p>GIVE the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king&rsquo;s son.</p>
                    <p>2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</p>
                    <p>3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</p>

                    <p>7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
                    </p>
                    <p>8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</p>
                    <p>9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
                    </p>
                    <p>10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall

                    <p>A Psalm of Asaph.</p>
                    <p>TRULY God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good to
                        Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to such as are of a clean heart.</p>
                    <p>2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
                    <p>3 For I was envious at the foolish,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I saw the
                        prosperity of the wicked.</p>
                    <p>4 For<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no bands
                        in their death: but their strength<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>firm.</p>
                    <p>5 They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not in
                        trouble<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men;
                        neither are they plagued like<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men.</p>
                    <p>6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth
                        them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a garment.</p>
                    <p>7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>
                    <p>8 They are corrupt, and speak
                        wickedly<span>&nbsp;</span><em>concerning</em><span>&nbsp;</span>oppression: they speak loftily.
                    </p>
                    <p>9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>
                    <p>10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a
                        full<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cup</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are wrung out to them.</p>
                    <p>11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
                    <p>12 Behold, these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the ungodly, who prosper in the
                        world; they increase<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>riches.</p>
                    <p>13 Verily I have cleansed my heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vain, and
                        washed my hands in innocency.</p>
                    <p>14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>
                    <p>15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should
                        offend<span>&nbsp;</span><em>against</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the generation of thy children.</p>
                    <p>16 When I thought to know this, it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>too painful
                        for me;</p>
                    <p>17 Until I went into the sanctuary of
                        God;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>understood I their end.</p>
                    <p>18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>
                    <p>19 How are they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>brought</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into desolation, as in a
                        moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
                    <p>20 As a dream
                        when<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>awaketh;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, O
                        Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>
                    <p>21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>
                    <p>22 So foolish<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I, and ignorant: I
                        was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a beast before thee.</p>
                    <p>23 Nevertheless I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>continually with thee: thou
                        hast holden<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by my right hand.</p>
                    <p>24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive
                        me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory.</p>
                    <p>25 Whom have I in
                        heaven<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                        upon earth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I desire beside thee.</p>
                    <p>26 My flesh and my heart
                        faileth:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
                    <p>27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a
                        whoring from thee.</p>
                    <p>28 But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good for me
                        to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy works.</p>

                    <p>22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</p>

                        increaseth continually.</p>

                    <p>I CRIED unto God with my voice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto God with

                        diligent search.</p>
                    <p>7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p>

                    <p>14 Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the God that doest wonders: thou hast

                    <p>2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
                    <p>3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
                    <p>4 We will not hide<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from their children, shewing

                        that he hath done.</p>
                    <p>5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our
                        fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
                    <p>6 That the generation to come might
                        know<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        children<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>should be

                        declare<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to their children:</p>
                    <p>7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his
                        commandments:</p>
                    <p>8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a
                        generation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>set not their heart aright, and
                        whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
                    <p>9 The children of

                    <p>10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
                    <p>11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
                    <p>12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of
                        Egypt,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the field of Zoan.</p>
                    <p>13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an
                        heap.</p>
                    <p>14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
                    <p>15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and
                        gave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>drink
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>out</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the great
                        depths.</p>
                    <p>16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
                    <p>17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
                    <p>19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
                    <p>20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give
                        bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
                    <p>21 Therefore the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em>, and was wroth: so
                        a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
                    <p>22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
                    <p>23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
                    <p>24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
                    <p>25 Man did eat angels&rsquo; food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
                    <p>26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
                    </p>
                    <p>27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
                    <p>28 And he let<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fall in the midst of their camp,
                        round about their habitations.</p>
                    <p>29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
                    <p>30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their
                        meat<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet in their mouths,</p>
                    <p>31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the
                        chosen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of Israel.</p>
                    <p>32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
                    <p>33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
                    <p>34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.</p>
                    <p>35 And they remembered that God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their rock, and
                        the high God their redeemer.</p>
                    <p>36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
                    </p>
                    <p>37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
                    <p>38 But he,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>full of compassion,
                        forgave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>iniquity, and
                        destroyed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not: yea, many a time turned he his
                        anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
                    <p>39 For he remembered that
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>flesh; a
                        wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
                    <p>40 How oft did they provoke him in the
                        wilderness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>grieve him in the desert!</p>
                    <p>41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
                    <p>42 They remembered not his hand,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nor</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the day when he
                        delivered them from the enemy.</p>
                    <p>43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>
                    <p>44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
                    <p>45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed
                        them.</p>
                    <p>46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
                    <p>47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
                    <p>48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
                    <p>49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending
                        evil angels<span>&nbsp;</span><em>among</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to
                        the pestilence;</p>
                    <p>51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
                    <p>52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a
                        flock.</p>
                    <p>53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
                    <p>54 And he brought them to the border of his
                        sanctuary,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this
                        mountain,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his right hand had purchased.</p>
                    <p>55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made
                        the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
                    <p>56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
                    <p>57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a
                        deceitful bow.</p>
                    <p>58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their
                        graven images.</p>
                    <p>59 When God heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
                    <p>60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the
                        tent<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he placed among men;</p>
                    <p>61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy&rsquo;s hand.</p>
                    <p>62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
                    <p>63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
                    <p>64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
                    <p>65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of
                        sleep,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like a mighty man that shouteth by
                        reason of wine.</p>
                    <p>66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
                    <p>67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
                    <p>68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
                    <p>69 And he built his sanctuary like high<span>&nbsp;</span><em>palaces</em>, like the earth which
                        he hath established for ever.</p>
                    <p>70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
                    <p>71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel
                        his inheritance.</p>
                    <p>72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of
                        his hands.</p>

                    <p>O GOD, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have
                        laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>
                    <p>2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they

                        the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</p>
                    <p>3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;

                        bury<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about
                        us.</p>
                    <p>5 How long, Lord? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>
                    <p>6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have
                        not called upon thy name.</p>
                    <p>7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</p>
                    <p>8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we
                        are brought very low.</p>
                    <p>9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our
                        sins, for thy name&rsquo;s sake.</p>
                    <p>10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their
                        God? let him be known among the heathen in our

                    </p>
                    <p>11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power
                        preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</p>
                    <p>12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have
                        reproached thee, O Lord.</p>

                    <p>LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p>
                    <p>2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.</p>

                    <p>8 I will hear what God the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will speak: for he will speak peace unto his

                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>about

                    <p>8 O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of hosts, who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        strong Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</p>
                    <p>9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</p>
                    <p>10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with
                        thy strong arm.</p>
                    <p>11 The heavens<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine, the earth
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</p>
                    <p>12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy
                        hand,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>high is thy right hand.</p>
                    <p>14 Justice and judgment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the habitation of thy
                        throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</p>
                    <p>15 Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the people that know the joyful sound:
                        they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.</p>
                    <p>16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 For thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the glory of their strength: and in
                        thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</p>
                    <p>18 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our defence; and the Holy One of
                        Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our king.</p>
                    <p>19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help
                        upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mighty;
                        I have exalted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>chosen out of the people.</p>
                    <p>20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</p>
                    <p>21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</p>
                    <p>22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>
                    <p>23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</p>
                    <p>24 But my faithfulness and my
                        mercy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him:
                        and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
                    <p>25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</p>
                    <p>26 He shall cry unto me, Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my father, my God,
                        and the rock of my salvation.</p>
                    <p>27 Also I will make him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>firstborn, higher than
                        the kings of the earth.</p>
                    <p>28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</p>
                    <p>29 His seed also will I
                        make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>endure</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for ever,
                        and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
                    <p>30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</p>
                    <p>31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</p>
                    <p>32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</p>
                    <p>33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to
                        fail.</p>
                    <p>34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>
                    <p>35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</p>
                    <p>36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</p>
                    <p>37 It shall be established for ever as the moon,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</p>
                    <p>38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</p>
                    <p>39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his
                        crown<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>casting</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        the ground.</p>
                    <p>40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</p>
                    <p>41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
                    <p>42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
                    </p>
                    <p>43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</p>
                    <p>44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
                    <p>45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</p>
                    <p>46 How long, Lord? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</p>
                    <p>47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</p>

                        and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</p>

                    <p>A Prayer of Moses the man of God.</p>
                    <p>LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>
                    <p>2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
                        even from everlasting to everlasting, thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God.
                    </p>
                    <p>3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</p>
                    <p>4 For a thousand years in thy
                        sight<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        yesterday when it is past, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a watch in the
                        night.</p>
                    <p>5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they
                        are<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a sleep: in the
                        morning<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like

                    <p>6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
                    </p>
                    <p>7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>

                        it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>
                    <p>11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
                        fear,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy wrath.

                    <p>13 Return, O Lord, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>
                    <p>14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may
                        bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
                    <p>15 And wine<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>maketh glad the heart of
                        man,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>oil to
                        make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>face to shine, and

                    <p>16 The trees of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>are
                        full<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>sap;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the cedars
                        of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
                    <p>17 Where the birds make their

                        the fir trees<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>her house.</p>
                    <p>18 The high hills<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a refuge for the wild

                    <p>19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
                    <p>20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do
                        creep<span>&nbsp;</span><em>forth</em>.</p>
                    <p>21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
                    <p>22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
                    <p>23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
                    <p>24 O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of
                        thy riches.</p>

                    <p>27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest
                        give<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their meat in due season.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><em>That</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou givest them they gather: thou openest
                        thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
                    <p>29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return
                        to their dust.</p>
                    <p>30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
                    <p>31 The glory of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall endure for ever: the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall rejoice in his works.</p>
                    <p>32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
                    <p>33 I will sing unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God
                        while I have my being.</p>
                    <p>34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.</p>
                    <p>35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the
                        Lord, O my soul. Praise ye the Lord.</p>

                    <p>O GIVE thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</p>
                    <p>2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>

                    <p>8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the

                    <p>10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a

                        few, and strangers in it.</p>
                    <p>13 When they went from one nation to another,

                    <p>14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Saying</em>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
                    <p>16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
                    <p>17 He sent a man before
                        them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Joseph,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>who</em><span>&nbsp;</span>was
                        sold for a servant:</p>
                    <p>18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
                    <p>19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>tried him.</p>
                    <p>20 The king sent and loosed him;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the ruler of
                        the people, and let him go free.</p>
                    <p>21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
                    <p>22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
                    <p>23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
                    <p>24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
                    <p>25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
                    <p>26 He sent Moses his servant;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Aaron whom he had

                    <p>27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
                    <p>28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
                    <p>29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
                    <p>30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
                    <p>31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of
                        flies,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lice in all their coasts.</p>
                    <p>32 He gave them hail for rain,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>flaming fire in
                        their land.</p>
                    <p>33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
                    <p>34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
                    <p>35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
                    <p>36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
                    <p>37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not one
                        feeble<span>&nbsp;</span><em>person</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among their tribes.</p>
                    <p>38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
                    <p>39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
                    <p>40<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>people</em><span>&nbsp;</span>asked, and
                        he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
                    <p>41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry
                        places<span>&nbsp;</span><em>like</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a river.</p>
                    <p>42 For he remembered his holy promise,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Abraham
                        his servant.</p>
                    <p>43 And he brought forth his people with joy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his

                    <p>44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>

                        times.</p>
                    <p>4 Remember me, O Lord, with the
                        favour<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>bearest</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy

                        may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
                    <p>6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
                    <p>7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy
                        mercies; but provoked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the
                        sea,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the Red sea.</p>
                    <p>8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name&rsquo;s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be
                        known.</p>
                    <p>9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through
                        the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, and
                        redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
                    <p>12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
                    <p>13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
                    <p>14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
                    <p>15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
                    <p>16 They envied Moses also in the camp,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Aaron the
                        saint of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
                    <p>18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
                    <p>19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
                    <p>20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
                    <p>21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
                    <p>22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>terrible
                        things by the Red sea.</p>
                    <p>23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the
                        breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                    <p>24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
                    <p>25 But murmured in their tents,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hearkened not
                        unto the voice of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
                    <p>27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
                    <p>28 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
                    <p>29 Thus they provoked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to anger with their
                        inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
                    <p>30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the plague was stayed.</p>
                    <p>31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
                    <p>32 They angered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also at the waters of strife, so
                        that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
                    <p>33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
                    <p>34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded them:
                    </p>
                    <p>35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
                    <p>36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
                    <p>37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
                    <p>38 And shed innocent blood,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the blood of their
                        sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was
                        polluted with blood.</p>
                    <p>39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
                    <p>40 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>kindled against his people, insomuch
                        that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
                    <p>41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
                    <p>42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
                    <p>43 Many times did he deliver them; but they
                        provoked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with their counsel, and were brought
                        low for their iniquity.</p>
                    <p>44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
                    <p>45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his
                        mercies.</p>
                    <p>46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
                    <p>47 Save us, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give
                        thanks unto thy holy name,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to triumph in thy
                        praise.</p>
                    <p>48 Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of
                        Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.

                    <p>O GIVE thanks unto the Lord,
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good: for his
                        mercy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>endureth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for ever.</p>
                    <p>2 Let the redeemed of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>say<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, whom he hath
                        redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
                    <p>3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from
                        the south.</p>
                    <p>4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
                    <p>5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
                    <p>6 Then they cried unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in their
                        trouble,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he delivered them out of their

                    <p>7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down,

                    </p>
                    <p>14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
                    <p>15 Oh that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>would praise the

                    <p>29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
                    <p>30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>

                    <p>32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of
                        the elders.</p>
                    <p>33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
                    <p>34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
                    <p>35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
                    <p>36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
                    <p>37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
                    <p>38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to
                        decrease.</p>
                    <p>39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
                    <p>40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the
                        wilderness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>where</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        way.</p>
                    <p>41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and
                        maketh<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>families like a flock.</p>
                    <p>42 The righteous shall see<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall
                        stop her mouth.</p>
                    <p>43 Whoso<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wise, and will observe

                    <p>18 I will pay my vows unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>now in the presence of all his people,</p>

                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good: because

                    <p>2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>endureth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for

                    <p>3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his

                    <p>5 I called upon the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in distress: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered

                    <p>7 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I

                    <p>12 They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of

                    <p>17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>18 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.

                    <p>46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</p>

                        merciful unto me according to thy word.</p>
                    <p>59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
                    <p>60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>
                    <p>61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                        have not forgotten thy law.</p>
                    <p>62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
                    <p>63 I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a companion of
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that fear thee, and of them that keep thy
                        precepts.</p>
                    <p>64 The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</p>
                    <p>TETH.</p>
                    <p>65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Lord, according unto thy word.</p>
                    <p>66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</p>
                    <p>67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</p>
                    <p>68 Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good, and doest good; teach me thy
                        statutes.</p>
                    <p>69 The proud have forged a lie against me:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                        will keep thy precepts with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whole heart.</p>
                    <p>70 Their heart is as fat as grease;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I delight in
                        thy law.</p>
                    <p>71<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good for me that
                        I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</p>
                    <p>72 The law of thy mouth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better unto me than
                        thousands of gold and silver.</p>
                    <p>JOD.</p>
                    <p>73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy
                        commandments.</p>
                    <p>74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</p>
                    <p>75 I know, O Lord, that thy judgments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
                    </p>
                    <p>76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy
                        servant.</p>
                    <p>77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
                        law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my delight.</p>
                    <p>78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a
                        cause:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will meditate in thy precepts.</p>
                    <p>79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.</p>
                    <p>80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</p>
                    <p>CAPH.</p>
                    <p>81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I hope in
                        thy word.</p>
                    <p>82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
                    <p>83 For I am become like a bottle in the
                        smoke;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>do I not forget thy statutes.</p>
                    <p>84 How many<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the days of thy servant? when wilt
                        thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>
                    <p>85 The proud have digged pits for me, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        after thy law.</p>
                    <p>86 All thy commandments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>faithful: they persecute
                        me wrongfully; help thou me.</p>
                    <p>87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</p>
                    <p>88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</p>
                    <p>LAMED.</p>
                    <p>89 For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>
                    <p>90 Thy faithfulness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto all generations: thou
                        hast established the earth, and it abideth.</p>
                    <p>91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy servants.</p>
                    <p>92 Unless thy
                        law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</p>
                    <p>93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</p>
                    <p>94 I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine, save me; for I have sought thy
                        precepts.</p>
                    <p>95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy
                        me:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will consider thy testimonies.</p>
                    <p>96 I have seen an end of all perfection:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        commandment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>exceeding broad.</p>
                    <p>MEM.</p>
                    <p>97 O how love I thy law! it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my meditation all the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ever with me.</p>
                    <p>99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
                        testimonies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my meditation.</p>
                    <p>100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</p>
                    <p>101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</p>
                    <p>102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</p>
                    <p>103 How sweet are thy words unto my
                        taste!<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yea</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>sweeter</em><span>&nbsp;</span>than
                        honey to my mouth!</p>
                    <p>104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</p>
                    <p>NUN.</p>
                    <p>105 Thy word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a lamp unto my feet, and a light
                        unto my path.</p>
                    <p>106 I have sworn, and I will perform<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, that I will keep thy
                        righteous judgments.</p>
                    <p>107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy word.</p>
                    <p>108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me thy
                        judgments.</p>
                    <p>109 My soul<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>continually in my hand: yet do I not
                        forget thy law.</p>
                    <p>110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>
                    <p>111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
                    <p>112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes
                        alway,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        end.</p>
                    <p>SAMECH.</p>
                    <p>113 I hate<span>&nbsp;</span><em>vain</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>
                    <p>114 Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my hiding place and my shield: I hope
                        in thy word.</p>
                    <p>115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>
                    <p>116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
                    <p>117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
                    </p>
                    <p>118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their
                        deceit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>falsehood.</p>
                    <p>119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the
                        earth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>like</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.
                    </p>
                    <p>120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>
                    <p>AIN.</p>
                    <p>121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</p>
                    <p>122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</p>
                    <p>123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</p>
                    <p>124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>
                    <p>125 I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy servant; give me understanding, that I
                        may know thy testimonies.</p>
                    <p>126<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>time
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em>, Lord, to
                        work:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they have made void thy law.</p>
                    <p>127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.</p>
                    <p>128 Therefore I esteem
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>precepts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>concerning</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                        hate every false way.</p>
                    <p>PE.</p>
                    <p>129 Thy testimonies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wonderful: therefore doth my
                        soul keep them.</p>
                    <p>130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>
                    <p>131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</p>
                    <p>132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy
                        name.</p>
                    <p>133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
                    <p>134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>
                    <p>135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>
                    <p>136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>
                    <p>TZADDI.</p>
                    <p>137 Righteous<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou, O Lord, and
                        upright<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy judgments.</p>
                    <p>138 Thy testimonies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast
                        commanded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>righteous and very faithful.</p>
                    <p>139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.</p>
                    <p>140 Thy word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very pure: therefore thy servant
                        loveth it.</p>
                    <p>141 I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>small and
                        despised:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>do not I forget thy precepts.</p>
                    <p>142 Thy righteousness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an everlasting
                        righteousness, and thy law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the truth.</p>
                    <p>143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on
                        me:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        commandments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my delights.</p>
                    <p>144 The righteousness of thy
                        testimonies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>everlasting: give me understanding,
                        and I shall live.</p>
                    <p>KOPH.</p>
                    <p>145 I cried with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whole heart; hear me, O Lord: I
                        will keep thy statutes.</p>
                    <p>146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.</p>
                    <p>147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>
                    <p>148 Mine eyes prevent the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>night</em><span>&nbsp;</span>watches, that I
                        might meditate in thy word.</p>
                    <p>149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O Lord, quicken me according to thy
                        judgment.</p>
                    <p>150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.</p>
                    <p>151 Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near, O Lord; and all thy
                        commandments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>truth.</p>
                    <p>152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>
                    <p>RESH.</p>
                    <p>153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.</p>
                    <p>154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.</p>
                    <p>155 Salvation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>far from the wicked: for they seek
                        not thy statutes.</p>
                    <p>156 Great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me
                        according to thy judgments.</p>
                    <p>157 Many<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my persecutors and mine
                        enemies;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>do I not decline from thy testimonies.
                    </p>
                    <p>158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.</p>
                    <p>159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O Lord, according to thy lovingkindness.</p>
                    <p>160 Thy
                        word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>true<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        beginning: and every one of thy righteous
                        judgments<span>&nbsp;</span><em>endureth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for ever.</p>
                    <p>SCHIN.</p>

                    <p>4 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>righteous: he hath cut asunder the

                    <p>2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my

                    <p>2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>
                    <p>3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted

                    <p>7 Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said,

                    <p>Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.</p>
                    <p>I CRIED unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with my voice; with my voice unto the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>did I make my supplication.</p>
                    <p>2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.</p>
                    <p>3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I
                        walked have they privily laid a snare for me.</p>
                    <p>4 I looked on<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right hand, and beheld,
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no man
                        that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.</p>
                    <p>5 I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        refuge<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my portion in the land of the living.
                    </p>
                    <p>6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are
                        stronger than I.</p>
                    <p>7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about;
                        for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.</p>

                    <p>HEAR my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer
                        me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in thy righteousness.</p>
                    <p>2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be

                    <p>3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made
                        me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.</p>
                    <p>4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</p>
                    <p>5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</p>

                        Selah.</p>
                    <p>7 Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto
                        them that go down into the pit.</p>
                    <p>8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know
                        the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</p>
                    <p>9 Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</p>
                    <p>10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my God: thy
                        spirit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good; lead me into the land of
                        uprightness.</p>
                    <p>11 Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name&rsquo;s sake: for thy righteousness&rsquo; sake bring my soul
                        out of trouble.</p>
                    <p>12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for

                    <p>5 Great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our Lord, and of great power: his

                    <p>6 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.</p>
                    <p>7 Sing unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:
                    </p>
                    <p>8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow
                        upon the mountains.</p>
                    <p>9 He giveth to the beast his food,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the young
                        ravens which cry.</p>
                    <p>10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
                    </p>
                    <p>11 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his
                        mercy.</p>
                    <p>12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.</p>
                    <p>13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</p>
                    <p>14 He maketh peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                        borders,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>filleth thee with the finest of the
                        wheat.</p>
                    <p>15 He sendeth forth his commandment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>upon</em><span>&nbsp;</span>earth: his
                        word runneth very swiftly.</p>
                    <p>16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.</p>
                    <p>17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?</p>
                    <p>18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to
                        blow,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the waters flow.</p>
                    <p>19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</p>
                    <p>20 He hath not dealt so with any nation:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>judgments,
                        they have not known them. Praise ye the Lord.</p>
