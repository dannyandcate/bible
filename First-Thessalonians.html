                    <p>PAUL, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Thessalonians&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in God the
                            Father</span><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord
                        Jesus Christ: Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto you, and peace, from
                        God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers<span>;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>3 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our
                        Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</p>
                    <p>4 Knowing,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>brethren</span><span>&nbsp;</span>beloved, your election of
                        God.</p>
                    <p>5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in
                        much assurance<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>as ye know what manner of men we were among you
                        for your sake.</p>
                    <p>6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction,
                        with joy of the Holy Ghost:</p>
                    <p>7 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</p>
                    <p>8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in
                        every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>so that we
                        need not to speak any thing.</p>
                    <p>9 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to
                        God from idols to serve the living and true God<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
                        dead,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>FOR yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><span>vain</span>:</p>
                    <p>2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at
                        Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</p>
                    <p>3 For our exhortation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not of deceit, nor of
                        uncleanness, nor in guile:</p>
                    <p>4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as
                        pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</p>
                    <p>5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness;
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witness:</p>
                    <p>6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you,
                        nor<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of others, when we might have been
                        burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</p>
                    <p>7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</p>
                    <p>8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the
                        gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</p>
                    <p>9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we
                        would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</p>
                    <p>10 Ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>witnesses, and
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>also</em>, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves
                        among you that believe:</p>
                    <p>11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a
                        father<span>&nbsp;</span><em>doth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his children,</p>
                    <p>12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</p>
                    <p>13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God
                        which ye heard of us, ye
                        received<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
                        believe.</p>
                    <p>14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of<span>&nbsp;</span><span>God
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>in Jud&aelig;a are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered
                        like things of your own countrymen, even as
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the Jews:</p>
                    <p>15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they
                        please not God, and are contrary to all men:</p>
                    <p>16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway:
                        for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</p>
                    <p>17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured
                        the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</p>
                    <p>18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</p>
                    <p>19 For what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our hope, or joy, or crown of
                        rejoicing?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not even ye in the presence of our
                        Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</p>
                    <p>20 For ye are our glory and joy.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>WHEREFORE when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens
                        alone<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of
                        Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</p>
                    <p>3 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed
                        thereunto.</p>
                    <p>4 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer
                        tribulation<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>even as it came to pass, and ye know.</p>
                    <p>5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means
                        the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</p>
                    <p>6 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and
                        charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>see</em><span>&nbsp;</span>you:</p>
                    <p>7 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your
                        faith:</p>
                    <p>8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</p>
                    <p>9 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your
                        sakes before our God;</p>
                    <p>10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is
                        lacking in your faith?</p>
                    <p>11 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</p>
                    <p>12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, even as
                        we<span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>toward you:</p>
                    <p>13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at

                        received of us how ye ought to walk and to please
                        God,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye would abound more and more.</p>
                    <p>2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</p>
                    <p>3 For this is the will of
                        God,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your<span>&nbsp;</span><span>sanctification,
                            that</span><span>&nbsp;</span>ye should abstain from fornication:</p>
                    <p>4 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</p>
                    <p>5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Gentiles
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>know not God:</p>
                    <p>6 That no<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>go beyond and defraud his brother
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>matter: because that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the avenger of all such, as we also have
                        forewarned you and testified.</p>
                    <p>7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>
                    <p>8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us
                        his<span>&nbsp;</span><span>holy</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Spirit.</p>
                    <p>9 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught
                        of God to love one another.</p>
                    <p>10 And indeed ye do it toward all the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>brethren
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye
                        increase more and more;</p>
                    <p>11 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands,
                        as we commanded you<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>12 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye may have lack of nothing.</p>
                    <p>13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning<span>&nbsp;</span><span>them
                            which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others</span><span>&nbsp;</span>which have no
                        hope.</p>
                    <p>14 For if we believe that Jesus died
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><span>rose</span><span>&nbsp;</span>again, even so them also which sleep
                        in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>
                    <p>15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that<span>&nbsp;</span><span>we
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>are
                        alive<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
                        not prevent them which are asleep.</p>
                    <p>16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,
                        and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</p>
                    <p>17 Then<span>&nbsp;</span><span>we which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>are
                        alive<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>remain shall be caught up together with
                        them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
                    <p>18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>

                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;</span>drunken are drunken in the night.</p>
                    <p>8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><span>an</span><span>&nbsp;</span>helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
                    <p>9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
                    <p>10 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</p>
                    <p>11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</p>
                    <p>12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know<span>&nbsp;</span><span>them
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish
                        you;</p>
                    <p>13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work&rsquo;s
                        sake.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be at peace among yourselves.</p>
                    <p>14 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the
                        weak,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;</span>patient toward
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>.</p>
                    <p>15 See that none render evil for evil unto
                        any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but ever follow that which is good, both
                        among<span>&nbsp;</span><span>yourselves</span>, and to all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>.</p>
                    <p>16 Rejoice evermore.</p>
                    <p><span>17 Pray without ceasing.</span></p>
                    <p>18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
                    <p>19 Quench not the Spirit.</p>
                    <p>20 Despise not prophesyings.</p>
                    <p>21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>
                    <p>22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
                    <p>23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>pray</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>God</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your
                        whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>24 Faithful<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that calleth you, who also will
                        do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>25 Brethren, pray for us.</p>
                    <p>26 Greet all the brethren with<span>&nbsp;</span><span>an</span><span>&nbsp;</span>holy kiss.</p>
                    <p>27 I charge you by the Lord that this
                        epistle<span>&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;</span>read unto all the holy brethren.</p>
                    <p>28 The grace of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>be</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>with you. Amen.</p>
