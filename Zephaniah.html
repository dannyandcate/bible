                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of
                        Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of
                        Judah.</p>
                    <p>2 I will utterly consume all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from off the
                        land, saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>3 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the
                        sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith
                        the Lord.</p>
                    <p>4 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I
                        will cut off the remnant of Baal from this
                        place,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the name of the Chemarims with the
                        priests;</p>
                    <p>5 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that
                        worship<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that swear by the Lord, and that swear
                        by Malcham;</p>
                    <p>6 And them<span>&nbsp;</span><span>that are</span><span>&nbsp;</span>turned back from the Lord;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>those</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that have not sought the Lord, nor
                        inquired for him.</p>
                    <p>7 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God: for the day of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at hand: for the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.</p>
                    <p>8 And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord&rsquo;s sacrifice, that I will punish the
                        princes, and the king&rsquo;s children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.</p>
                    <p>9 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their
                        masters&rsquo; houses with violence and<span>&nbsp;</span><span>deceit.</span></p>
                    <p>10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        noise of a cry from the fish gate,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><span>an</span><span>&nbsp;</span>howling from the second, and a great
                        crashing from the hills.</p>
                    <p>11 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear
                        silver are cut off.</p>
                    <p>12 And it shall come to pass at that time,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                        will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say
                        in their heart, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will not do good, neither will he do evil.</p>
                    <p>13 Therefore their goods shall become<span>&nbsp;</span><span>a booty</span>, and their houses a
                        desolation: they shall also build houses, but not
                        inhabit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and they shall plant vineyards, but
                        not drink the wine thereof.</p>
                    <p>14 The great day of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near,
                        and hasteth greatly,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the voice of the day of
                        the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</p>
                    <p>15 That day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a day of wrath, a day of trouble and
                        distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds
                        and thick darkness,</p>
                    <p>16 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.</p>
                    <p>17 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have
                        sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the
                        dung.</p>
                    <p>18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the
                        Lord&rsquo;s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he
                        shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</p>

                    <p>3 Her princes within her<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>roaring lions; her

                    <p>6 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none

                    </p>
                    <p>7 I said,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Surely</span><span>&nbsp;</span>thou wilt fear me, thou wilt

                        earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p>
                    <p>9 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the
                        Lord, to serve him with one consent.</p>
                    <p>10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my

                        and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</p>
                    <p>12 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in
                        the name of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>13 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue
                        be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall
                        make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>afraid.</p>

                    <p>15 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the

                    <p>16 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou

                    <p>17 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God in the midst of
                        thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over
                        thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.</p>
                    <p>18 I will
                        gather<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sorrowful
                        for the solemn assembly,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>who</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are of
                        thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>whom</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        reproach of it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a burden.</p>
                    <p>19 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and
                        gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they
                        have been put to shame.</p>
                    <p>20 At that time will I bring you<span>&nbsp;</span><em>again</em>, even in the time that I gather
                        you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back
                        your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.</p>
