                    <p><span>NOW in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord&nbsp;by the mouth
                            of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord&nbsp;stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,
                            that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom,
                            and&nbsp;<em>put</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;also in writing, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord&nbsp;God of heaven hath given me all the
                            kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem,
                            which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;among you of all his people? his God be
                            with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Judah, and build
                            the house of the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, (he&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the God,)
                            which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help
                            him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill
                            offering for the house of God that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests,
                            and the Levites, with all&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;whose spirit God had raised, to go up to
                            build the house of the Lord&nbsp;which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And all they that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;about them strengthened their hands with
                            vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside
                            all&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;was willingly offered.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which
                            Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his
                            gods;</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer,
                            and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And this&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand

                    <p><span>10 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second&nbsp;<em>sort</em>&nbsp;four hundred

                    <p><span>11 All the vessels of gold and of silver&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;five thousand and four
                            hundred. All&nbsp;<em>these</em>&nbsp;did Sheshbazzar bring up
                            with&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;the captivity that were brought up from
                            Babylon unto Jerusalem.</span></p>

                            garments.</span></p>

                            Lord,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;burnt offerings morning and evening.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 They kept also the feast of tabernacles,
                            as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;written, and&nbsp;<em>offered</em>&nbsp;the daily
                            burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day
                            required;</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And afterward&nbsp;<em>offered</em>&nbsp;the continual burnt offering, both of the new
                            moons, and of all the set feasts of the Lord&nbsp;that were consecrated, and of every one
                            that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the
                            Lord. But the foundation of the temple of the Lord&nbsp;was
                            not&nbsp;<em>yet</em>&nbsp;laid.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and
                            oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea
                            of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in
                            the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and
                            the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out
                            of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and
                            upward, to set forward the work of the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Then stood Jeshua&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his
                            sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons
                            of Henadad,&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;their sons and their brethren the Levites.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the
                            priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to
                            praise the Lord, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord;
                            because&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good, for his
                            mercy&nbsp;<em>endureth</em>&nbsp;for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a
                            great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the
                            Lord&nbsp;was laid.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the
                            fathers,&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;ancient men, that had seen the first
                            house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice;
                            and many shouted aloud for joy:</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the
                            weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard
                            afar off.</span></p>

                    <p><span>2 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us
                            build with you: for we seek your God, as ye&nbsp;<em>do;</em>&nbsp;and we do sacrifice unto
                            him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</span></p>

                            commanded us.</span></p>

                    <p><span>8 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to

                            walls&nbsp;<em>thereof</em>, and joined the foundations.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set
                            up&nbsp;<em>again</em>,&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom,
                            and&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Now because we have maintenance

                    <p><span>15 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in

                            and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of

                    <p><span>16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded&nbsp;<em>again</em>, and the walls

                    <p><span>17&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Then</em>&nbsp;sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor,

                    <p><span>19 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time
                            hath made insurrection against kings, and&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;rebellion and sedition
                            have been made therein.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over
                            all&nbsp;<em>countries</em>&nbsp;beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid
                            unto them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded,
                            until&nbsp;<em>another</em>&nbsp;commandment shall be given from me.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the
                            kings?</span></p>
                    <p><span>23&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes&rsquo;
                            letter&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their
                            companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by
                            force and power.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;at Jerusalem. So it
                            ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</span></p>

                    <p><span>8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the

                    <p><span>10 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men

                            carried the people away into Babylon.</span></p>

                            of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were
                            delivered unto&nbsp;<em>one</em>, whose name&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Sheshbazzar, whom he had

                    <p><span>2 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in the province
                            of the Medes, a roll, and therein&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a record thus written:</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 In the first year of Cyrus the king&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>same</em>&nbsp;Cyrus the
                            king made a decree&nbsp;<em>concerning</em>&nbsp;the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the
                            house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof
                            be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the breadth
                            thereof threescore cubits;</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;<em>With</em>&nbsp;three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the
                            expences be given out of the king&rsquo;s house:</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took
                            forth out of the temple which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon,
                            be restored, and brought again unto the temple which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;at
                            Jerusalem,&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;to his place, and
                            place&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;in the house of God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Now&nbsp;<em>therefore</em>, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your
                            companions the Apharsachites, which&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;beyond the river, be ye far from
                            thence:</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of
                            the Jews build this house of God in his place.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of
                            this house of God: that of the king&rsquo;s goods,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;of the tribute
                            beyond the river, forthwith expences be given unto these men, that they be not
                            hindered.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt
                            offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of
                            the priests which&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day
                            without fail:</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the
                            life of the king, and of his sons.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled
                            down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made
                            a dunghill for this.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that
                            shall put to their hand to alter&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to destroy this house of God
                            which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with
                            speed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their
                            companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai
                            the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished&nbsp;<em>it</em>,
                            according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of
                            Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth
                            year of the reign of Darius the king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the
                            children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred
                            rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according
                            to the number of the tribes of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the
                            service of God, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of
                            Moses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
                            fourteenth&nbsp;<em>day</em>&nbsp;of the first month.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
                            them&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the
                            captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had
                            separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, did eat,</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the Lord&nbsp;had made
                            them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their
                            hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</span></p>

                    <p><span>NOW after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah,
                            the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,</span></p>

                            priest:</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a ready scribe in the law
                            of Moses, which the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his
                            request, according to the hand of the Lord&nbsp;his God upon him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And there went up&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of the children of Israel, and of the priests,
                            and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the

                    <p><span>8 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;in the seventh
                            year of the king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 For upon the first&nbsp;<em>day</em>&nbsp;of the first month began he to go up from

                    <p><span>10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do&nbsp;<em>it</em>,
                            and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the copy of the letter that the king
                            Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;a scribe of the
                            words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of

                    <p><span>13 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;his

                    <p><span>14 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellers, to inquire
                            concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God
                            which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in thine hand;</span></p>

                    <p><span>16 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with
                            the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of
                            their God which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem:</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat
                            offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God
                            which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the
                            silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy
                            God,&nbsp;<em>those</em>&nbsp;deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have

                            house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And I,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the

                            the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done
                            speedily,</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an

                    <p><span>23 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of
                            the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his
                            sons?</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters,
                            Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll,
                            tribute, or custom, upon them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in thine hand,
                            set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people
                            that&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and
                            teach ye them that know&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be
                            executed speedily upon him, whether&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;unto death, or to
                            banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;God of our fathers, which hath
                            put&nbsp;<em>such</em>&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;<em>thing</em>&nbsp;as this in the king&rsquo;s
                            heart, to beautify the house of the Lord&nbsp;which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in
                            Jerusalem:</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellers, and before all the
                            king&rsquo;s mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the Lord&nbsp;my
                            God&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up
                            with me.</span></p>

                    <p><span>14 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there
                            abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none
                            of the sons of Levi.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and
                            for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for
                            Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told
                            them what they should say unto Iddo,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to his brethren the Nethinims,
                            at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our
                            God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the
                            sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his
                            brethren, eighteen;</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons,
                            twenty;</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the
                            Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict
                            ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and
                            for all our substance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us
                            against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our
                            God&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his
                            wrath&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;against all them that forsake him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah,
                            and ten of their brethren with them,</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the
                            vessels,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and
                            his counsellers, and his lords, and all Israel&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;present, had
                            offered:</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver
                            vessels an hundred talents,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;of gold an hundred talents;</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper,
                            precious as gold.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And I said unto them, Ye&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;holy unto the Lord; the
                            vessels&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;holy also; and the silver and the
                            gold&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;a freewill offering unto the Lord&nbsp;God of your
                            fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 Watch ye, and keep&nbsp;<em>them</em>, until ye weigh&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;before the
                            chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in
                            the chambers of the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the
                            vessels, to bring&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the
                            twelfth&nbsp;<em>day</em>&nbsp;of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our
                            God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait
                            by the way.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in
                            the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with
                            him&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with
                            them&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui,
                            Levites;</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 By number&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;by weight of every one: and all the weight was written
                            at that time.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35&nbsp;<em>Also</em>&nbsp;the children of those that had been carried away, which were
                            come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks
                            for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he
                            goats&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;a sin offering: all&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a
                            burnt offering unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36&nbsp;&nbsp;And they delivered the king&rsquo;s commissions unto the king&rsquo;s
                            lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and
                            the house of God.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>NOW when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and
                            the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the
                            lands,&nbsp;<em>doing</em>&nbsp;according to their abominations,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;of
                            the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites,
                            the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the
                            holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of&nbsp;<em>those</em>&nbsp;lands: yea,
                            the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of
                            my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel,
                            because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until
                            the evening sacrifice.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my
                            garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord&nbsp;my
                            God,</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our
                            iniquities are increased over&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;head, and our trespass is grown up unto
                            the heavens.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Since the days of our fathers&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;we&nbsp;<em>been</em>&nbsp;in a
                            great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our
                            kings,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the
                            lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face,
                            as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;this day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And now for a little space grace hath been&nbsp;<em>shewed</em>&nbsp;from the
                            Lord&nbsp;our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place,
                            that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 For we&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage,
                            but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving,
                            to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall
                            in Judah and in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy
                            commandments,</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye
                            go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with
                            their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their
                            uncleanness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto
                            your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the
                            good of the land, and leave&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;for an inheritance to your children for
                            ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass,
                            seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities&nbsp;<em>deserve</em>,
                            and hast given us&nbsp;<em>such</em>&nbsp;deliverance as this;</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these
                            abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed&nbsp;<em>us</em>,
                            so that&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;no remnant nor
                            escaping?</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 O Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, thou&nbsp;<em>art</em>&nbsp;righteous: for we remain yet
                            escaped, as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;this day: behold,
                            we&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee
                            because of this.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>NOW when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down
                            before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of
                            men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel,&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;of the sons of Elam, answered
                            and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the
                            people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as
                            are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the
                            commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Arise; for&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;matter&nbsp;<em>belongeth</em>&nbsp;unto thee: we
                            also&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with thee: be of good courage, and
                            do&nbsp;<em>it</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that
                            they should do according to this word. And they sware.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of
                            Johanan the son of Eliashib: and&nbsp;<em>when</em>&nbsp;he came thither, he did eat no
                            bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been
                            carried away.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the
                            captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the
                            princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from
                            the congregation of those that had been carried away.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto
                            Jerusalem within three days. It&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the ninth month, on the
                            twentieth&nbsp;<em>day</em>&nbsp;of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the
                            house of God, trembling because of&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;matter, and for the great
                            rain.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken
                            strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Now therefore make confession unto the Lord&nbsp;God of your fathers, and do his
                            pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange
                            wives.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so
                            must we do.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 But the people&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;many, and&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a
                            time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without,
                            neither&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;a work of one day or two: for we are many
                            that have transgressed in this thing.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken
                            strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city,
                            and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from
                            us.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed
                            about this&nbsp;<em>matter:</em>&nbsp;and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped
                            them.</span></p>
