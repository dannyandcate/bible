                    <p>PAUL, a servant of Jesus Christ,
                        called<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an apostle,
                        separated unto the gospel of God,</p>
                    <p>2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</p>
                    <p>3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the
                        flesh;</p>
                    <p>4 And declared<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
                    </p>
                    <p>5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations,
                        for his name:</p>
                    <p>6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
                    <p>7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God,
                        called<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>saints:
                        Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout
                        the whole world.</p>
                    <p>9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without
                        ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>
                    <p>10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of
                        God to come unto you.</p>
                    <p>11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be
                        established;</p>
                    <p>12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>
                    <p>13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but
                        was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>
                    <p>16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to
                        every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
                    <p>17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The
                        just shall live by faith.</p>
                    <p>18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
                        men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
                    <p>19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath
                        shewed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto them.</p>
                    <p>20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
                        understood by the things that are made,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                        eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>
                    <p>21 Because that, when they knew God, they
                        glorified<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not as God, neither were thankful;
                        but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
                    <p>22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
                    <p>23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and
                        to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
                    <p>24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to
                        dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
                    <p>25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the
                        Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
                    <p>26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the
                        natural use into that which is against nature:</p>
                    <p>27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one
                        toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that
                        recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
                    <p>28 And even as they did not like to retain God
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>knowledge, God gave them over to a
                        reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>
                    <p>29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness;
                        full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>
                    <p>30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient
                        to parents,</p>
                    <p>31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
                    </p>
                    <p>32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not
                        only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>

                    <p>THEREFORE thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest
                        another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</p>
                    <p>2 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such
                        things.</p>
                    <p>3 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that
                        thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
                    <p>4 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing
                        that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>
                    <p>5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
                        wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>
                    <p>6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>
                    <p>7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality,
                        eternal life:</p>
                    <p>8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
                        indignation and wrath,</p>
                    <p>9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of
                        the Gentile;</p>
                    <p>10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to
                        the Gentile:</p>
                    <p>11 For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
                    <p>12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have
                        sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</p>
                    <p>13 (For not the hearers of the law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>just before
                        God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
                    <p>14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,
                        these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</p>
                    <p>15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thoughts the mean while accusing or else
                        excusing one another;)</p>
                    <p>16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</p>
                    <p>17 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
                    <p>18 And knowest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will, and approvest the things
                        that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</p>
                    <p>19 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in
                        darkness,</p>
                    <p>20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the
                        truth in the law.</p>
                    <p>21 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man
                        should not steal, dost thou steal?</p>
                    <p>22 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that
                        abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</p>
                    <p>23 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</p>
                    <p>24 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>
                    <p>25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law,
                        thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
                    <p>26 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his
                        uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
                    <p>27 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the
                        letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</p>
                    <p>28 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly;
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>circumcision,
                        which is outward in the flesh:</p>
                    <p>29 But he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a Jew, which is one inwardly; and
                        circumcision<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        the heart, in the spirit,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not in the letter;
                        whose praise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not of men, but of God.</p>

                    <p>3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
                    </p>

                    <p>5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we
                        say?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I

                        judged as a sinner?</p>
                    <p>8 And not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>rather</em>, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm
                        that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
                    <p>9 What then? are we

                        no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>

                    <p>11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
                    <p>12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that

                    <p>14 Whose mouth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>full of cursing and bitterness:

                    <p>19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law:
                        that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
                    <p>20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the
                        law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the knowledge of sin.</p>
                    <p>21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and
                        the prophets;</p>
                    <p>22 Even the righteousness of
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by faith of
                        Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>
                    <p>23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
                    <p>24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
                    <p>25 Whom God hath set
                        forth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins
                        that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
                    <p>26 To declare,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>say</em>, at this time his
                        righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>
                    <p>27 Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>boasting then? It is excluded. By what
                        law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</p>
                    <p>28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
                    <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the God of the
                        Jews only?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>
                    <p>30 Seeing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>one God,
                        which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
                    <p>31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</p>

                    <p>WHAT shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</p>
                    <p>2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he
                        hath<span>&nbsp;</span><em>whereof</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to glory; but not before God.</p>
                    <p>3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for
                        righteousness.</p>
                    <p>4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</p>
                    <p>5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is
                        counted for righteousness.</p>
                    <p>6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness
                        without works,</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Saying</em>,
                        Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
                        whose sins are covered.</p>
                    <p>8 Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the man to whom the Lord will not
                        impute sin.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Cometh</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this blessedness then upon the
                        circumcision<span>&nbsp;</span><em>only</em>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that
                        faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</p>
                    <p>10 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in
                        circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</p>
                    <p>11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>being
                        uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not
                        circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</p>
                    <p>12 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk
                        in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>being<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>uncircumcised.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the
                        world,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not to Abraham, or to his seed, through
                        the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</p>
                    <p>14 For if they which are of the law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>heirs, faith
                        is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</p>
                    <p>15 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law
                        is,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        transgression.</p>
                    <p>16 Therefore<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        faith,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>might</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by
                        grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the
                        law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</p>
                    <p>17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he
                        believed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God, who quickeneth the dead, and
                        calleth those things which be not as though they were.</p>
                    <p>18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according
                        to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</p>
                    <p>19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an
                        hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara&rsquo;s womb:</p>
                    <p>20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory
                        to God;</p>
                    <p>21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</p>
                    <p>22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</p>
                    <p>23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</p>
                    <p>24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our
                        Lord from the dead;</p>
                    <p>25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THEREFORE being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
                    <p>2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of
                        the glory of God.</p>
                    <p>3 And not only<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that
                        tribulation worketh patience;</p>
                    <p>4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>
                    <p>5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
                        Ghost which is given unto us.</p>
                    <p>6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</p>
                    <p>7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even
                        dare to die.</p>
                    <p>8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
                    </p>
                    <p>9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</p>
                    <p>10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more,
                        being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</p>
                    <p>11 And not only<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
                        Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>
                    <p>12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed
                        upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p>
                    <p>13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p>
                    <p>14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the
                        similitude of Adam&rsquo;s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>
                    <p>15 But not as the offence, so also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the free gift.
                        For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by
                        grace,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by one
                        man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</p>
                    <p>16 And not as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by
                        one that
                        sinned,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the gift:
                        for the judgment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by one to condemnation, but
                        the free gift<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of many offences unto
                        justification.</p>
                    <p>17 For if by one man&rsquo;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance
                        of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</p>
                    <p>18 Therefore as by the offence of
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>judgment</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>came</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon
                        all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>free</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>gift</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>came</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon
                        all men unto justification of life.</p>
                    <p>19 For as by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one
                        shall many be made righteous.</p>
                    <p>20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did
                        much more abound:</p>
                    <p>21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto
                        eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>WHAT shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</p>
                    <p>2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
                    <p>3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
                        death?</p>
                    <p>4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from
                        the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
                    <p>5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>likeness</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>resurrection:
                    </p>
                    <p>6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, that the body
                        of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>
                    <p>7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
                    <p>8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</p>
                    <p>9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over
                        him.</p>
                    <p>10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>
                    <p>11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through
                        Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
                    <p>12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
                    </p>
                    <p>13 Neither yield ye your members<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>instruments of
                        unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead,
                        and your members<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>instruments of righteousness
                        unto God.</p>
                    <p>14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</p>
                    <p>15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>
                    <p>16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
                        obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
                    <p>17 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that
                        form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p>
                    <p>18 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</p>
                    <p>19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded
                        your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your
                        members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>
                    <p>20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</p>
                    <p>21 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>death.</p>
                    <p>22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
                        holiness, and the end everlasting life.</p>
                    <p>23 For the wages of sin<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>death; but the gift of
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>KNOW ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion
                        over a man as long as he liveth?</p>
                    <p>2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>husband so long as he liveth; but if the
                        husband be dead, she is loosed from the law
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>husband.</p>
                    <p>3 So then if, while<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>husband liveth, she be
                        married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is
                        free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</p>
                    <p>4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye
                        should be married to another,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to him who is
                        raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</p>
                    <p>5 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our
                        members to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>
                    <p>6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should
                        serve in newness of spirit, and not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the oldness
                        of the letter.</p>
                    <p>7 What shall we say then?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the law sin? God
                        forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had
                        said, Thou shalt not covet.</p>
                    <p>8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For
                        without the law sin<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dead.</p>
                    <p>9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
                    </p>
                    <p>10 And the commandment,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ordained</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        life, I found<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                        death.</p>
                    <p>11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it
                        slew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em>.</p>
                    <p>12 Wherefore the law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holy, and the commandment
                        holy, and just, and good.</p>
                    <p>13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin,
                        working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding
                        sinful.</p>
                    <p>14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</p>
                    <p>15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
                    </p>
                    <p>16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good.</p>
                    <p>17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
                    <p>18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present
                        with me; but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to perform that which is good I
                        find not.</p>
                    <p>19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</p>
                    <p>20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
                    <p>21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</p>
                    <p>22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</p>
                    <p>23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into
                        captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</p>
                    <p>24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>
                    <p>25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of
                        God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><em>THERE</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therefore now no condemnation to
                        them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
                    <p>2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and
                        death.</p>
                    <p>3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son
                        in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</p>
                    <p>4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but
                        after the Spirit.</p>
                    <p>5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
                        Spirit the things of the Spirit.</p>
                    <p>6 For to be carnally minded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>death; but to be
                        spiritually minded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>life and peace.</p>
                    <p>7 Because the carnal mind<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>enmity against God: for
                        it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>
                    <p>8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>
                    <p>9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
                        Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>
                    <p>10 And if Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in you, the
                        body<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dead because of sin; but the
                        Spirit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>life because of righteousness.</p>
                    <p>11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
                        Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
                    </p>
                    <p>12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</p>
                    <p>13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the
                        deeds of the body, ye shall live.</p>
                    <p>14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</p>
                    <p>15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit
                        of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</p>
                    <p>16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>
                    <p>17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we
                        suffer with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, that we may be also glorified together.</p>
                    <p>18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present
                        time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        worthy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>compared</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        the glory which shall be revealed in us.</p>
                    <p>19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
                    </p>
                    <p>20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
                        subjected<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>same</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        hope,</p>
                    <p>21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
                        glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
                    <p>22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</p>
                    <p>23 And not only<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em>, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
                        of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
                        adoption,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>wit</em>, the redemption of our
                        body.</p>
                    <p>24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he
                        yet hope for?</p>
                    <p>25 But if we hope for that we see not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>do we
                        with patience wait for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as
                        we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
                        uttered.</p>
                    <p>27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh
                        intercession for the saints according
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God.
                    </p>
                    <p>28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the
                        called according to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>purpose.</p>
                    <p>29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did
                        predestinate<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>conformed
                        to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</p>
                    <p>30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also
                        justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p>
                    <p>31 What shall we then say to these things? If
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for us,
                        who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>can</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against us?
                    </p>
                    <p>32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him
                        also freely give us all things?</p>
                    <p>33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God&rsquo;s
                        elect?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>God that
                        justifieth.</p>
                    <p>34 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that
                        condemneth?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Christ
                        that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
                        maketh intercession for us.</p>
                    <p>35 Who shall separate us from the love of
                        Christ?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>tribulation, or distress, or
                        persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</p>
                    <p>36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for
                        the slaughter.</p>
                    <p>37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</p>
                    <p>38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
                        nor things present, nor things to come,</p>
                    <p>39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
                        God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

                    <p>6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For

                        then?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unrighteousness
                        with God? God forbid.</p>
                    <p>15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
                        on whom I will have compassion.</p>
                    <p>16 So then<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not of
                        him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p>
                    <p>17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I
                        might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</p>
                    <p>18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he
                        will<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>mercy</em>, and whom he will he
                        hardeneth.</p>
                    <p>19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</p>
                    <p>20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that
                        formed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, Why hast thou made me thus?</p>
                    <p>21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and
                        another unto dishonour?</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><em>What</em><span>&nbsp;</span>if God, willing to
                        shew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wrath, and to make his power known,
                        endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</p>
                    <p>23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had
                        afore prepared unto glory,</p>
                    <p>24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</p>
                    <p>25 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her
                        beloved, which was not beloved.</p>
                    <p>26 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the place
                        where it was said unto them, Ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not my people;
                        there shall they be called the children of the living God.</p>
                    <p>27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the
                        sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</p>
                    <p>28 For he will finish the work, and cut<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>short in
                        righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</p>
                    <p>29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as
                        Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</p>
                    <p>30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have
                        attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</p>
                    <p>31 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of
                        righteousness.</p>
                    <p>32 Wherefore?
                        Because<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>sought</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</p>
                    <p>33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever
                        believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>BRETHREN, my heart&rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</p>
                    <p>2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</p>
                    <p>3 For they being ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness, and going about to establish their own
                        righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</p>
                    <p>4 For Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the end of the law for righteousness
                        to every one that believeth.</p>
                    <p>5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those
                        things shall live by them.</p>
                    <p>6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who
                        shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ
                        down<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>above:</em>)</p>
                    <p>7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)</p>
                    <p>8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</p>
                    <p>9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that
                        God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>
                    <p>10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made
                        unto salvation.</p>
                    <p>11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
                    <p>12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich
                        unto all that call upon him.</p>
                    <p>13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
                    <p>14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in
                        him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</p>
                    <p>15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet
                        of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</p>
                    <p>16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
                    </p>
                    <p>17 So then faith<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cometh</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by hearing, and hearing by
                        the word of God.</p>
                    <p>18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their
                        words unto the ends of the world.</p>
                    <p>19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy
                        by<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by a foolish nation I will anger you.
                    </p>
                    <p>20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made
                        manifest unto them that asked not after me.</p>
                    <p>21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and
                        gainsaying people.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>I SAY then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of
                        Abraham,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
                    <p>2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of
                        Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</p>
                    <p>3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and
                        they seek my life.</p>
                    <p>4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who
                        have not bowed the knee
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>image</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Baal.
                    </p>
                    <p>5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
                    </p>
                    <p>6 And if by grace,
                        then<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no more of
                        works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of works, then
                        is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
                    <p>7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained
                        it, and the rest were blinded</p>
                    <p>8 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should
                        not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>
                    <p>9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a
                        recompence unto them:</p>
                    <p>10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
                    <p>11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid:
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>rather</em><span>&nbsp;</span>through their fall
                        salvation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>come</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                        the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
                    <p>12 Now if the fall of them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the riches of the
                        world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</p>
                    <p>13 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine
                        office:</p>
                    <p>14 If by any means I may provoke to
                        emulation<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        flesh, and might save some of them.</p>
                    <p>15 For if the casting away of them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        reconciling of the world, what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        receiving<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em>,
                        but life from the dead?</p>
                    <p>16 For if the firstfruit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holy, the
                        lump<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>holy:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and
                        if the root<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holy,
                        so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the branches.</p>
                    <p>17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in
                        among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>
                    <p>18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root
                        thee.</p>
                    <p>19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</p>
                    <p>20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded,
                        but fear:</p>
                    <p>21 For if God spared not the natural
                        branches,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>take</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>heed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lest
                        he also spare not thee.</p>
                    <p>22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward
                        thee, goodness, if thou continue in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>goodness:
                        otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
                    <p>23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to
                        graff them in again.</p>
                    <p>24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary
                        to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the
                        natural<span>&nbsp;</span><em>branches</em>, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
                    <p>25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise
                        in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the
                        Gentiles be come in.</p>
                    <p>26 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the
                        Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
                    <p>27 For this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my covenant unto them, when I shall
                        take away their sins.</p>
                    <p>28 As concerning the
                        gospel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>enemies
                        for your sakes: but as touching the
                        election,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beloved
                        for the fathers&rsquo; sakes.</p>
                    <p>29 For the gifts and calling of God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>without
                        repentance.</p>
                    <p>30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their
                        unbelief:</p>
                    <p>31 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
                    </p>
                    <p>32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
                    <p>33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
                        unsearchable<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his judgments, and his ways past
                        finding out!</p>
                    <p>34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?</p>
                    <p>35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>
                    <p>36 For of him, and through him, and to him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all
                        things: to whom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory for ever. Amen.</p>

                        God,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your
                        reasonable service.</p>
                    <p>2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye
                        may prove what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that good, and acceptable, and
                        perfect, will of God.</p>
                    <p>3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to
                        think<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>himself</em><span>&nbsp;</span>more
                        highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man
                        the measure of faith.</p>
                    <p>4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</p>
                    <p>5 So we,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>many, are one body in Christ, and
                        every one members one of another.</p>
                    <p>6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether
                        prophecy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>prophesy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>according
                        to the proportion of faith;</p>
                    <p>7 Or
                        ministry,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>wait</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on<span>&nbsp;</span><em>our</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ministering:
                        or he that teacheth, on teaching;</p>
                    <p>8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that
                        giveth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>love be without dissimulation. Abhor that
                        which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>kindly affectioned one to another with
                        brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</p>
                    <p>11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>
                    <p>12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</p>
                    <p>13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p>
                    <p>14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</p>
                    <p>15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the same mind one toward another. Mind not
                        high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</p>
                    <p>17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</p>
                    <p>18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p>
                    <p>19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves,
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>rather</em><span>&nbsp;</span>give place unto wrath: for it is
                        written, Vengeance<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine; I will repay, saith the
                        Lord.</p>
                    <p>20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou
                        shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</p>
                    <p>21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>

                    <p>LET every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers
                        that be are ordained of God.</p>
                    <p>2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist
                        shall receive to themselves damnation.</p>
                    <p>3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the
                        power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</p>
                    <p>4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid;
                        for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>execute</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wrath upon him that doeth evil.</p>
                    <p>5 Wherefore<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span>must needs be subject, not only for
                        wrath, but also for conscience sake.</p>
                    <p>6 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God&rsquo;s ministers, attending
                        continually upon this very thing.</p>
                    <p>7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom
                        tribute<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>due;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>custom
                        to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</p>
                    <p>8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the
                        law.</p>
                    <p>9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
                        not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>any other
                        commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
                        thyself.</p>
                    <p>10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore
                        love<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the fulfilling of the law.</p>
                    <p>11 And that, knowing the time, that
                        now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>high time to
                        awake out of sleep: for now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our salvation nearer
                        than when we believed.</p>
                    <p>12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,
                        and let us put on the armour of light.</p>
                    <p>13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and
                        wantonness, not in strife and envying.</p>
                    <p>14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh,
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>fulfil</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                    <p>HIM that is weak in the faith receive ye,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not to
                        doubtful disputations.</p>
                    <p>2 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</p>
                    <p>3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him
                        that eateth: for God hath received him.</p>
                    <p>4 Who art thou that judgest another man&rsquo;s servant? to his own master he standeth or
                        falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
                    <p>5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every
                        day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>alike</em>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</p>
                    <p>6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto the
                        Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not
                        regard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God
                        thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
                    <p>7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>
                    <p>8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether
                        we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s.</p>
                    <p>9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead
                        and living.</p>
                    <p>10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall
                        all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
                    <p>11 For it is written,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I live, saith the Lord,
                        every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
                    <p>12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
                    <p>13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a
                        stumblingblock or an occasion to fall
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brother&rsquo;s way.</p>
                    <p>14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing
                        unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unclean.</p>
                    <p>15 But if thy brother be grieved with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>meat, now
                        walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
                    <p>16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>
                    <p>17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the
                        Holy Ghost.</p>
                    <p>18 For he that in these things serveth
                        Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>acceptable to God, and approved of men.
                    </p>
                    <p>19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may
                        edify another.</p>
                    <p>20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things
                        indeed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pure;
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>evil for that
                        man who eateth with offence.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good neither to
                        eat flesh, nor to drink wine,
                        nor<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whereby
                        thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</p>
                    <p>22 Hast thou faith? have<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to thyself before God.
                        Happy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that condemneth not himself in that
                        thing which he alloweth.</p>
                    <p>23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat,
                        because<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>eateth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not of

                    <p>WE then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>2 Let every one of us please<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>neighbour

                    <p>3 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that
                        reproached thee fell on me.</p>
                    <p>4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through
                        patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</p>
                    <p>5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according
                        to Christ Jesus:</p>
                    <p>6 That ye may with one mind<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>one mouth glorify
                        God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>7 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</p>
                    <p>8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm
                        the promises<span>&nbsp;</span><em>made</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto the fathers:</p>
                    <p>9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mercy; as it is written, For this cause I
                        will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.</p>
                    <p>10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</p>
                    <p>11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.</p>
                    <p>12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over
                        the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.</p>
                    <p>13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope,
                        through the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                    <p>14 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled
                        with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</p>
                    <p>15 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you
                        in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,</p>
                    <p>16 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God,
                        that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to
                        God.</p>
                    <p>18 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to
                        make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</p>
                    <p>19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem,
                        and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</p>
                    <p>20 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build
                        upon another man&rsquo;s foundation:</p>
                    <p>21 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not
                        heard shall understand.</p>
                    <p>22 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</p>
                    <p>23 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to
                        come unto you;</p>
                    <p>24 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my
                        journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with
                        your<span>&nbsp;</span><em>company</em>.</p>
                    <p>25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</p>
                    <p>26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor
                        saints which are at Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>27 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made
                        partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
                    </p>
                    <p>28 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you
                        into Spain.</p>
                    <p>29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the
                        gospel of Christ.</p>
                    <p>30 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake, and for the love of the
                        Spirit, that ye strive together with me
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prayers to God for me;</p>
                    <p>31 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Jud&aelig;a; and that my service
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for
                        Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;</p>
                    <p>32 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.</p>
                    <p>33 Now the God of peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you all. Amen.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>I COMMEND unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:</p>
                    <p>2 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever
                        business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.</p>
                    <p>3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:</p>
                    <p>4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all
                        the churches of the Gentiles.</p>
                    <p>5 Likewise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>greet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the church that is in their house.
                        Salute my wellbeloved Ep&aelig;netus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.</p>
                    <p>6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.</p>
                    <p>7 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the
                        apostles, who also were in Christ before me.</p>
                    <p>8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.</p>
                    <p>9 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.</p>
                    <p>10 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
                        Aristobulus&rsquo;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>household</em>.</p>
                    <p>11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>household</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.
                    </p>
                    <p>12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which
                        laboured much in the Lord.</p>
                    <p>13 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.</p>
                    <p>14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which
                        are with them.</p>
                    <p>16 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.</p>
                    <p>17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the
                        doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.</p>
                    <p>18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words
                        and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.</p>
                    <p>19 For your obedience is come abroad unto all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>. I am glad therefore
                        on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning
                        evil.</p>
                    <p>20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you. Amen.</p>
                    <p>21 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.</p>
                    <p>22 I Tertius, who wrote<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>epistle, salute you in
                        the Lord.</p>
                    <p>23 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city
                        saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.</p>
                    <p>24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you
                        all. Amen.</p>
                    <p>25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus
                        Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
                    </p>
                    <p>26 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment
                        of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:</p>
                    <p>27 To God only wise,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory through Jesus Christ
                        for ever. Amen.</p>
