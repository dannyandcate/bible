                    <p><span>AND Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the Lord&nbsp;his
                            God&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to
                            the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place
                            that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of
                            God, which Moses the servant of the Lord&nbsp;had made in the wilderness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim
                            to&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>place</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;David had prepared for it:
                            for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put
                            before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the Lord,
                            which&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand
                            burnt offerings upon it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall
                            give thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast
                            made me to reign in his stead.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Now, O Lord&nbsp;God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast
                            made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for
                            who can judge this thy
                            people,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;great?</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked
                            riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life;
                            but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom
                            I have made thee king:</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Wisdom and knowledge&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;granted unto thee; and I will give thee
                            riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had
                            that&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;<em>been</em>&nbsp;before thee, neither shall there any after
                            thee have the like.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Solomon
                            came&nbsp;<em>from</em>&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;<em>journey</em>&nbsp;to the high place
                            that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
                            congregation, and reigned over Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred
                            chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
                            king at Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And the king made silver and gold at
                            Jerusalem&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;<em>plenteous</em>&nbsp;as stones, and cedar trees made he
                            as the sycomore trees that&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in the vale for abundance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king&rsquo;s merchants
                            received the linen yarn at a price.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six
                            hundred&nbsp;<em>shekels</em>&nbsp;of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so
                            brought they out&nbsp;<em>horses</em>&nbsp;for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the
                            kings of Syria, by their means.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the Lord, and an house for his
                            kingdom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore
                            thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with

                            therein,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;<em>deal</em>&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;<em>me</em>.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>4 Behold, I build an house to the name of the Lord&nbsp;my God, to
                            dedicate&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;to him,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to burn before him sweet
                            incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening,
                            on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the Lord&nbsp;our God.
                            This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>an</em>&nbsp;<em>ordinance</em>&nbsp;for ever to
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And the house which I build&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;great: for
                            great&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;our God above all gods.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot
                            contain him? who&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;I then, that I should build him an house, save only
                            to burn sacrifice before him?</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in
                            iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
                            that&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did
                            provide.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy
                            servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my
                            servants&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with thy servants,</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to

                    <p><span>10 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand

                            of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon,
                            Because the Lord&nbsp;hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Huram said moreover, Blessed&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, that
                            made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and
                            understanding, that might build an house for the Lord, and an house for his kingdom.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>13 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my
                            father&rsquo;s,</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a man
                            of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber,
                            in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving,
                            and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the
                            cunning men of my lord David thy father.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath
                            spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to
                            thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solomon numbered all the strangers that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in the
                            land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they
                            were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And he set threescore and ten thousand of
                            them&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;bearers of burdens, and fourscore
                            thousand&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;hewers in the mountain, and three thousand

                            thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;according to

                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wings of the cherubims&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;twenty cubits long:

                    <p><span>13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on
                            their feet, and their faces&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;inward.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;And he made the vail&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;blue, and purple, and crimson, and
                            fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the
                            chapiter that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;on the top of each of them&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;five
                            cubits.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And he made chains,&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;in the oracle, and
                            put&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates,
                            and put&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;on the chains.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on
                            the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the

                    <p><span>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass,

                    <p><span>4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the

                    <p><span>10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</span></p>

                            that he made with the children of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;And he stood before the altar of the Lord&nbsp;in the presence of all the
                            congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and
                            three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and
                            kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his
                            hands toward heaven,</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And said, O Lord&nbsp;God of Israel,&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;no God
                            like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant,
                            and&nbsp;<em>shewest</em>&nbsp;mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their
                            hearts:</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him;
                            and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;with thine hand,
                            as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;this day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 Now therefore, O Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that
                            which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit
                            upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my
                            law, as thou hast walked before me.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Now then, O Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken
                            unto thy servant David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of
                            heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O
                            Lord&nbsp;my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before
                            thee:</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou
                            hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy
                            servant prayeth toward this place.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which
                            they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling
                            place,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him
                            swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by
                            recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him
                            according to his righteousness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24&nbsp;&nbsp;And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they
                            have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make
                            supplication before thee in this house;</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring
                            them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned
                            against thee;&nbsp;<em>yet</em>&nbsp;if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name,
                            and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people
                            Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain
                            upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28&nbsp;&nbsp;If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting,
                            or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their
                            land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>be:</em></span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>29&nbsp;<em>Then</em>&nbsp;what prayer&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;what supplication soever shall
                            be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and
                            his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man
                            according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of
                            the children of men:)</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which
                            thou gavest unto our fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is
                            come from a far country for thy great name&rsquo;s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy
                            stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 Then hear thou from the heavens,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;from thy dwelling place, and do
                            according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may
                            know thy name, and fear thee, as&nbsp;<em>doth</em>&nbsp;thy people Israel, and may know

                            built for thy name;</span></p>
                    <p><span>35 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their
                            cause.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 If they sin against thee, (for&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;no man which
                            sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over

                            we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;</span></p>
                    <p><span>38 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their
                            captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou

                    <p><span>40 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and&nbsp;<em>let</em>&nbsp;thine

                    <p><span>41 Now therefore arise, O Lord&nbsp;God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy
                            strength: let thy priests, O Lord&nbsp;God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints
                            rejoice in goodness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>42 O Lord&nbsp;God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David

                    <p><span>NOW when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed
                            the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord&nbsp;filled the
                            house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the
                            Lord&nbsp;had filled the Lord&rsquo;s house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the
                            Lord&nbsp;upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the
                            pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord,&nbsp;<em>saying</em>,
                            For&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good; for his mercy<em>endureth</em>&nbsp;for
                            ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and
                            twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of
                            the Lord, which David the king had made to praise the Lord, because his
                            mercy&nbsp;<em>endureth</em>&nbsp;for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the
                            priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;before the
                            house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings,
                            because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings,
                            and the meat offerings, and the fat.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with
                            him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of
                            Egypt.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the
                            altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into
                            their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the Lord&nbsp;had shewed unto
                            David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king&rsquo;s house: and all that
                            came into Solomon&rsquo;s heart to make in the house of the Lord, and in his own house, he
                            prosperously effected.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord&nbsp;appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have
                            heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the
                            land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek
                            my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
                            their sin, and will heal their land.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
                            prayer&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>made</em>&nbsp;in this place.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and
                            mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do
                            according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my
                            judgments;</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with
                            David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a
                            man&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;ruler in Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set
                            before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this
                            house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make
                            it&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a proverb and a byword among all nations.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it;
                            so that he shall say, Why hath the Lord&nbsp;done thus unto this land, and unto this
                            house?</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers, which
                            brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped
                            them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.</span></p>

                            the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in
                            Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>As</em>&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;all the
                            people&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;left of the Hittites, and the Amorites,
                            and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;not of
                            Israel,</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;<em>But</em>&nbsp;of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the
                            children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>9 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but
                            they&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his
                            chariots and horsemen.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And these&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;the chief of king Solomon&rsquo;s
                            officers,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the
                            people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto
                            the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of
                            David king of Israel,
                            because&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>places</em>&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;holy, whereunto the
                            ark of the Lord&nbsp;hath come.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the Lord&nbsp;on the altar of the
                            Lord, which he had built before the porch,</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on
                            the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the
                            year,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks,
                            and in the feast of tabernacles.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of
                            the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister
                            before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at
                            every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites
                            concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of
                            the Lord, and until it was finished.&nbsp;<em>So</em>&nbsp;the house of the Lord&nbsp;was
                            perfected.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17&nbsp;&nbsp;Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land
                            of Edom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge
                            of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four
                            hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;to king
                            Solomon.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>AND when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with
                            hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and
                            gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with
                            him of all that was in her heart.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he
                            told her not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had
                            built,</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his
                            ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by
                            which he went up into the house of the Lord; there was no more spirit in her.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And she said to the king,&nbsp;<em>It</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a true report which I
                            heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had
                            seen&nbsp;<em>it:</em>&nbsp;and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not
                            told me:&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;thou exceedest the fame that I heard.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Happy&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;thy men, and happy&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;these thy
                            servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Blessed be the Lord&nbsp;thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his
                            throne,&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;king for the Lord&nbsp;thy God: because thy
                            God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do
                            judgment and justice.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great
                            abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave
                            king Solomon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from
                            Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And the king made&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;the algum trees terraces to the house of the
                            Lord, and to the king&rsquo;s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were
                            none such seen before in the land of Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked,
                            beside&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went
                            away to her own land, she and her servants.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and
                            threescore and six talents of gold;</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Beside&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;chapmen and merchants brought. And
                            all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to
                            Solomon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;And king Solomon made two hundred targets&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;beaten gold:
                            six hundred&nbsp;<em>shekels</em>&nbsp;of beaten gold went to one target.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And three hundred
                            shields&nbsp;<em>made</em>&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;beaten gold: three
                            hundred&nbsp;<em>shekels</em>&nbsp;of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the
                            house of the forest of Lebanon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>18 And&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;six steps to the throne, with a
                            footstool of gold,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;fastened to the throne, and
                            stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There
                            was not the like made in any kingdom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the drinking vessels of king
                            Solomon&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;gold, and all the vessels of the house of
                            the forest of Lebanon&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;pure gold:
                            none&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;silver; it was&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;any
                            thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 For the king&rsquo;s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three
                            years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and
                            peacocks.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his
                            wisdom, that God had put in his heart.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
                            raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve
                            thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the
                            Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore
                            trees that&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in the low plains in abundance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and
                            last,&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
                            prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the
                            son of Nebat?</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father:
                            and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;in Egypt,
                            whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard&nbsp;<em>it</em>, that

                    <p><span>3 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam,
                            saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous
                            servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve
                            thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people
                            departed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6&nbsp;&nbsp;And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon
                            his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;to return
                            answer to this people?</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and
                            speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young
                            men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people,
                            which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon
                            us?</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou
                            answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make
                            thou&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My
                            little&nbsp;<em>finger</em>&nbsp;shall be thicker than my father&rsquo;s loins.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father
                            chastised you with whips, but
                            I&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>chastise</em>&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;with scorpions.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade,
                            saying, Come again to me on the third day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old
                            men,</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke
                            heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but
                            I&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>chastise</em>&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;with scorpions.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>15 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the
                            Lord&nbsp;might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to
                            Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;And when all Israel&nbsp;<em>saw</em>&nbsp;that the king would not hearken
                            unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?
                            and&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man
                            to your tents, O Israel:&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;now, David, see to thine own house. So all
                            Israel went to their tents.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 But&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;the children of Israel that dwelt in the
                            cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;over the tribute; and the
                            children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get
                            him up to&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>AND when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an
                            hundred and fourscore thousand chosen&nbsp;<em>men</em>, which were warriors, to fight
                            against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 But the word of the Lord&nbsp;came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and
                            Benjamin, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every
                            man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the Lord, and
                            returned from going against Jeroboam.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>6 He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam,</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in Judah and in
                            Benjamin fenced cities.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and
                            of oil and wine.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And in every several city&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>put</em>&nbsp;shields and spears,
                            and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;And the priests and the Levites that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in all Israel
                            resorted to him out of all their coasts.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and
                            Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest&rsquo;s
                            office unto the Lord:</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves
                            which he had made.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord&nbsp;God of their
                            fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong,
                            three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to
                            wife,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai,
                            and Ziza, and Shelomith.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his
                            concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and
                            eight sons, and threescore daughters.)</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the
                            chief,&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;ruler among his brethren:
                            for&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>thought</em>&nbsp;to make him king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of
                            Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
                            desired many wives.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>AND it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened
                            himself, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And it came to pass,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak
                            king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the
                            Lord,</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the
                            people&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims,
                            the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And he took the fenced cities which&nbsp;<em>pertained</em>&nbsp;to Judah, and came to
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;the
                            princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto
                            them, Thus saith the Lord, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the
                            hand of Shishak.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The
                            Lord&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;righteous.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And when the Lord&nbsp;saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord&nbsp;came
                            to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;&nbsp;<em>therefore</em>&nbsp;I will not
                            destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out
                            upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service
                            of the kingdoms of the countries.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the
                            house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king&rsquo;s house; he took all: he carried away
                            also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
                            committed&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the
                            entrance of the king&rsquo;s house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And when the king entered into the house of the Lord, the guard came and fetched them,
                            and brought them again into the guard chamber.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord&nbsp;turned from him, that he would
                            not destroy&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for
                            Rehoboam&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he
                            reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord&nbsp;had chosen out of all the
                            tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother&rsquo;s
                            name&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Naamah an Ammonitess.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last,&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;they not written in the
                            book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?
                            And&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
                            continually.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his
                            son reigned in his stead.</span></p>

                    <p><span>NOW in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name
                            also&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war
                            between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
                            war,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle

                            men of valour.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in mount
                            Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Ought ye not to know that the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to
                            David for ever,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and
                            hath rebelled against his lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened
                            themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted,
                            and could not withstand them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord&nbsp;in the hand of the sons of
                            David; and ye&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;a great multitude,
                            and&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made
                            you for gods.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Have ye not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and
                            have made you priests after the manner of the nations of&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;lands? so
                            that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven

                    <p><span>10 But as for us, the Lord&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;our God, and we have not forsaken him; and
                            the priests, which minister unto the Lord,&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the sons of Aaron, and the
                            Levites&nbsp;<em>wait</em>&nbsp;upon&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;business:</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And they burn unto the Lord&nbsp;every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and
                            sweet incense: the shewbread
                            also&nbsp;<em>set</em>&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;<em>order</em>&nbsp;upon the
                            pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for
                            we keep the charge of the Lordour God; but ye have forsaken him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And, behold, God himself&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;with us
                            for&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm
                            against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the Lord&nbsp;God of your fathers;
                            for ye shall not prosper.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were
                            before Judah, and the ambushment&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;behind them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;before and behind:
                            and they cried unto the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass,
                            that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their
                            hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of
                            Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah
                            prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns
                            thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the
                            Lord&nbsp;struck him, and he died.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21&nbsp;&nbsp;But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two
                            sons, and sixteen daughters.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his

                    <p><span>SO Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son
                            reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And Asa did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;good and right
                            in the eyes of the Lord&nbsp;his God:</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 For he took away the altars of the strange&nbsp;<em>gods</em>, and the high places, and
                            brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And commanded Judah to seek the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers, and to do the law and the
                            commandment.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the
                            kingdom was quiet before him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6&nbsp;&nbsp;And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war
                            in those years; because the Lord&nbsp;had given him rest.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
                            about&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;walls, and towers, gates, and
                            bars,&nbsp;<em>while</em>&nbsp;the land&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;yet before us; because we have
                            sought the Lord&nbsp;our God, we have sought&nbsp;<em>him</em>, and he hath given us rest on
                            every side. So they built and prospered.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And Asa had an army&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>men</em>&nbsp;that bare targets and spears,
                            out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows,
                            two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;mighty men of
                            valour.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand
                            thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of
                            Zephathah at Mareshah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And Asa cried unto the Lord&nbsp;his God, and said,
                            Lord,&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;nothing with thee to help, whether with many,
                            or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord&nbsp;our God; for we rest on thee, and in
                            thy name we go against this multitude. O Lord, thou&nbsp;<em>art</em>&nbsp;our God; let not
                            man prevail against thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 So the Lord&nbsp;smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians
                            fled.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And Asa and the people that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;with him pursued them unto Gerar:
                            and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were
                            destroyed before the Lord, and before his host; and they carried away very much
                            spoil.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the Lord&nbsp;came upon
                            them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and
                            returned to Jerusalem.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and
                            Benjamin; The Lord&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him,
                            he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Now for a long season Israel&nbsp;<em>hath</em>&nbsp;<em>been</em>&nbsp;without the true
                            God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, and sought him,
                            he was found of them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And in those times&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;no peace to him that went
                            out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;upon all the
                            inhabitants of the countries.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all
                            adversity.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be
                            rewarded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage,
                            and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
                            cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the Lord,
                            that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;before the porch of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and
                            Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw
                            that the Lord&nbsp;his God&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;with him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth
                            year of the reign of Asa.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And they offered unto the Lord&nbsp;the same time, of the
                            spoil&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
                            sheep.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers with all
                            their heart and with all their soul;</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 That whosoever would not seek the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel should be put to death,
                            whether small or great, whether man or woman.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And they sware unto the Lord&nbsp;with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with
                            trumpets, and with cornets.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought
                            him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord&nbsp;gave them rest
                            round about.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;And also&nbsp;<em>concerning</em>&nbsp;Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
                            removed her from&nbsp;<em>being</em>&nbsp;queen, because she had made an idol in a grove:
                            and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped&nbsp;<em>it</em>, and burnt&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;at
                            the brook Kidron.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was
                            perfect all his days.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had
                            dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And there was no&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;war unto the five and thirtieth year of the

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>IN the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against
                            Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king
                            of Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the
                            Lord&nbsp;and of the king&rsquo;s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at
                            Damascus, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;<em>There</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a league between me and thee,
                            as&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;between my father and thy father: behold, I
                            have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may
                            depart from me.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the
                            cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of
                            Naphtali.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard&nbsp;<em>it</em>, that he left off building of
                            Ramah, and let his work cease.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the
                            timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and
                            Mizpah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him,
                            Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the Lord&nbsp;thy God,
                            therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen?
                            yet, because thou didst rely on the Lord, he delivered them into thine hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 For the eyes of the Lord&nbsp;run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself
                            strong in the behalf of&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;whose heart&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;perfect
                            toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have
                            wars.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house;
                            for&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;in a rage with him because of
                            this&nbsp;<em>thing</em>. And Asa oppressed&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of the people the same
                            time.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his
                            disease&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;exceeding&nbsp;<em>great:</em>&nbsp;yet in his disease he
                            sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his
                            reign.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of
                            David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers
                            kinds&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>spices</em>&nbsp;prepared by the apothecaries&rsquo; art:
                            and they made a very great burning for him.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of

                    <p><span>3 And the Lord&nbsp;was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father

                    <p><span>4 But sought to the&nbsp;<em>Lord</em>&nbsp;God of his father, and walked in his

                    <p><span>5 Therefore the Lord&nbsp;stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to

                    <p><span>6 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord: moreover he took away the high

                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his

                    <p><span>11 Also&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and

                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and
                            cities of store.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of
                            valour,&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And these&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the numbers of them according to the house of their
                            fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of
                            valour three hundred thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And next to him&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred
                            and fourscore thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And next him&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered
                            himself unto the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and
                            shield two hundred thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And next him&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore
                            thousand ready prepared for the war.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 These waited on the king, beside&nbsp;<em>those</em>&nbsp;whom the king put in the

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>NOW Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>2 And after&nbsp;<em>certain</em>&nbsp;years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
                            killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people
                            that&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;with him, and persuaded him to go
                            up&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;to Ramoth-gilead.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to
                            Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;as thou&nbsp;<em>art</em>, and
                            my people as thy people; and&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with
                            thee in the war.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the
                            word of the Lord&nbsp;to day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said
                            unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up;
                            for God will deliver&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;into the king&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 But Jehoshaphat said,&nbsp;<em>Is</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;not here a prophet of the
                            Lord&nbsp;besides, that we might inquire of him?</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And the king of Israel said unto
                            Jehoshaphat,&nbsp;<em>There</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;yet one man, by whom we may inquire
                            of the Lord: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the
                            same&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king
                            say so.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And the king of Israel called for one&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;officers,
                            and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne,
                            clothed in&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in
                            of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the
                            Lord, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the
                            Lord&nbsp;shall deliver&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;into the hand of the king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of
                            the prophets&nbsp;<em>declare</em>&nbsp;good to the king with one assent; let thy word
                            therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And Micaiah said,&nbsp;<em>As</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;liveth, even what my God saith,
                            that will I speak.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to
                            Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they
                            shall be delivered into your hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but
                            the truth to me in the name of the Lord?</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no
                            shepherd: and the Lord&nbsp;said, These have no master; let them
                            return&nbsp;<em>therefore</em>&nbsp;every man to his house in peace.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
                            thee&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the Lord; I saw the Lord&nbsp;sitting upon his
                            throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;his
                            left.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And the Lord&nbsp;said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall
                            at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that
                            manner.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will entice him.
                            And the Lord&nbsp;said unto him, Wherewith?</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
                            And&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>Lord</em>&nbsp;said, Thou shalt entice&nbsp;<em>him</em>, and
                            thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;so.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Now therefore, behold, the Lord&nbsp;hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy
                            prophets, and the Lord&nbsp;hath spoken evil against thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and
                            said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord&nbsp;from me to speak unto thee?</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner
                            chamber to hide thyself.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor
                            of the city, and to Joash the king&rsquo;s son;</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this&nbsp;<em>fellow</em>&nbsp;in the prison, and feed
                            him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace,&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;hath not
                            the Lord&nbsp;spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the
                            battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to
                            the battle.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
                            that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only
                            with the king of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said,
                            It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight:
                            but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord&nbsp;helped him; and God moved
                            them&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>depart</em>&nbsp;from him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not
                            the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And a&nbsp;<em>certain</em>&nbsp;man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
                            Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine
                            hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
                            stayed&nbsp;<em>himself</em>&nbsp;up in&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;chariot against the Syrians
                            until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat,
                            Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord?
                            therefore&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;wrath upon thee from before the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves

                    <p><span>4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from
                            Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the Lord&nbsp;God of their
                            fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city
                            by city,</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord,

                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites,

                    <p><span>9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully, and

                    <p><span>8 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name,
                            saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 If,&nbsp;<em>when</em>&nbsp;evil cometh upon us,&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;the sword,
                            judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for
                            thy name&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then
                            thou wilt hear and help.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not
                            let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and
                            destroyed them not;</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Behold,&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;<em>say</em>,&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;they reward us, to
                            come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company
                            that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;upon
                            thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And all Judah stood before the Lord, with their little ones, their wives, and their
                            children.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of
                            Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the
                            Lord&nbsp;in the midst of the congregation;</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king
                            Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the Lord&nbsp;unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this
                            great multitude; for the battle&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;not yours, but God&rsquo;s.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye
                            shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Ye shall not&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;to fight in this&nbsp;<em>battle:</em>&nbsp;set
                            yourselves, stand ye&nbsp;<em>still</em>, and see the salvation of the Lord&nbsp;with you, O
                            Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the
                            Lord&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;face to the ground: and all
                            Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord, worshipping the Lord.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>19 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites,
                            stood up to praise the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of
                            Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye
                            inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord&nbsp;your God, so shall ye be established;
                            believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that
                            should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise
                            the Lord; for his mercy&nbsp;<em>endureth</em>&nbsp;for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord&nbsp;set ambushments
                            against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they
                            were smitten.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir,
                            utterly to slay and destroy&nbsp;<em>them:</em>&nbsp;and when they had made an end of the
                            inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the
                            multitude, and, behold, they&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;dead bodies fallen to the earth, and
                            none escaped.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found
                            among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they
                            stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in
                            gathering of the spoil, it was so much.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah;
                            for there they blessed the Lord: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley
                            of Berachah, unto this day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront
                            of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the Lord&nbsp;had made them to rejoice over
                            their enemies.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of&nbsp;<em>those</em>&nbsp;countries, when
                            they had heard that the Lord&nbsp;fought against the enemies of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jehoshaphat reigned over
                            Judah:&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;thirty and five years old when he began to
                            reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s
                            name&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it,
                            doing&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;right in the sight of
                            the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared
                            their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani,
                            who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35&nbsp;&nbsp;And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king
                            of Israel, who did very wickedly:</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships
                            in Ezion-geber.</span></p>
                    <p><span>37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying,
                            Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord&nbsp;hath broken thy works. And the
                            ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>NOW Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
                            David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and
                            Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;the sons of
                            Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things,
                            with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because
                            he&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the firstborn.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and
                            slew all his brethren with the sword, and&nbsp;<em>divers</em>&nbsp;also of the princes of
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehoram&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;thirty and two years old when he began to
                            reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he
                            had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he
                            wrought&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;evil in the eyes of
                            the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Howbeit the Lord&nbsp;would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that
                            he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for
                            ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made
                            themselves a king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up
                            by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the
                            chariots.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same
                            time&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken
                            the Lord&nbsp;God of his fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of
                            Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah&nbsp;<em>thereto</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith
                            the Lord&nbsp;God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of
                            Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the
                            inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and
                            also hast slain thy brethren of thy father&rsquo;s
                            house,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;better than thyself:</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Behold, with a great plague will the Lord&nbsp;smite thy people, and thy children, and
                            thy wives, and all thy goods:</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And thou&nbsp;<em>shalt</em>&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;great sickness by disease of thy
                            bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover the Lord&nbsp;stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
                            Philistines, and of the Arabians, that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;near the Ethiopians:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>17 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that
                            was found in the king&rsquo;s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was
                            never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all this the Lord&nbsp;smote him in his bowels with an incurable
                            disease.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels
                            fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no
                            burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem
                            eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of
                            David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the
                            band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the
                            son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Forty and two years old&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he
                            reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name also&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Athaliah
                            the daughter of Omri.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counseller to do
                            wickedly.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord&nbsp;like the house of Ahab: for they were
                            his counsellers after the death of his father to his destruction.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king
                            of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote
                            Joram.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at
                            Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of
                            Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he
                            went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord&nbsp;had anointed to cut
                            off the house of Ahab.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and
                            found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to
                            Ahaziah, he slew them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him
                            to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they,
                            he&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord&nbsp;with all his
                            heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose
                            and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him
                            from among the king&rsquo;s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber.
                            So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was
                            the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the
                            land.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds,
                            Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed,
                            and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with
                            him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah,
                            and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said
                            unto them, Behold, the king&rsquo;s son shall reign, as the Lord&nbsp;hath said of the sons
                            of David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on
                            the sabbath, of the priests and of the
                            Levites,&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;porters of the doors;</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And a third part&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;at the king&rsquo;s house; and
                            a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the
                            people&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;in the courts of the house of the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 But let none come into the house of the Lord, save the priests, and they that minister of
                            the Levites; they shall go in, for they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;holy: but all the people
                            shall keep the watch of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his
                            hand; and whosoever&nbsp;<em>else</em>&nbsp;cometh into the house, he shall be put to death:
                            but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had
                            commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
                            were to go&nbsp;<em>out</em>&nbsp;on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
                            courses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers,
                            and shields, that&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;<em>been</em>&nbsp;king David&rsquo;s,
                            which&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in the house of God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side
                            of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king
                            round about.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Then they brought out the king&rsquo;s son, and put upon him the crown,
                            and&nbsp;<em>gave</em>&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada
                            and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the
                            king, she came to the people into the house of the Lord:</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the
                            princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded
                            with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing
                            praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the
                            host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be
                            slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by
                            the king&rsquo;s house, they slew her there.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and
                            between the king, that they should be the Lord&rsquo;s people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars
                            and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord&nbsp;by the hand of the
                            priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the Lord, to offer the burnt
                            offerings of the Lord, as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;written in the law of
                            Moses, with rejoicing and with
                            singing,&nbsp;<em>as</em><em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;<em>ordained</em>&nbsp;by
                            David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that
                            none&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;unclean in any thing should enter in.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>20 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people,
                            and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the Lord: and
                            they came through the high gate into the king&rsquo;s house, and set the king upon the
                            throne of the kingdom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had
                            slain Athaliah with the sword.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>JOASH&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty
                            years in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name also&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Zibiah of
                            Beer-sheba.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And Joash did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;right in the
                            sight of the Lord&nbsp;all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass after this,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;Joash was minded to
                            repair the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the
                            cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
                            year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites
                            hastened&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required
                            of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the
                            collection,&nbsp;<em>according</em>&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>commandment</em>&nbsp;of
                            Moses the servant of the Lord, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of
                            witness?</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all
                            the dedicated things of the house of the Lord&nbsp;did they bestow upon Baalim.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And at the king&rsquo;s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of
                            the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the
                            Lord&nbsp;the collection&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;Moses the servant of
                            God&nbsp;<em>laid</em>&nbsp;upon Israel in the wilderness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the
                            chest, until they had made an end.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king&rsquo;s
                            office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw
                            that&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;much money, the king&rsquo;s scribe and the
                            high priest&rsquo;s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his
                            place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of
                            the Lord, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord, and also such as
                            wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of
                            God in his state, and strengthened it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And when they had finished&nbsp;<em>it</em>, they brought the rest of the money before
                            the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the
                            Lord,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;vessels to minister, and to offer&nbsp;<em>withal</em>, and
                            spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the
                            Lord&nbsp;continually all the days of Jehoiada.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and
                            thirty years old&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;when he died.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in
                            Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the
                            king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And they left the house of the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers, and served groves and
                            idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord; and they testified
                            against them: but they would not give ear.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood
                            above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of
                            the Lord, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken
                            you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the
                            king in the court of the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to
                            him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The Lord&nbsp;look upon&nbsp;<em>it</em>,
                            and require&nbsp;<em>it</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of the year,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;the host
                            of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the
                            princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of
                            Damascus.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the
                            Lord&nbsp;delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own
                            servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew
                            him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him
                            not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess,
                            and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;<em>concerning</em>&nbsp;his sons, and the greatness of the
                            burdens&nbsp;<em>laid</em>&nbsp;upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his
                            son reigned in his stead.</span></p>

                    <p><span>2 And he did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;right in the
                            sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his
                            servants that had killed the king his father.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 But he slew not their children,
                            but&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;written in the law in
                            the book of Moses, where the Lord&nbsp;commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the
                            children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his
                            own sin.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over
                            thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses
                            of&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them
                            from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand
                            choice&nbsp;<em>men</em>,&nbsp;<em>able</em>&nbsp;to go forth to war, that could handle
                            spear and shield.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred
                            talents of silver.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with
                            thee; for the Lord&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;not with
                            Israel,&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>wit</em>,&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;all the children of
                            Ephraim.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 But if thou wilt go, do&nbsp;<em>it</em>, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee
                            fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I
                            have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The Lord&nbsp;is able to give
                            thee much more than this.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Then Amaziah separated them,&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>wit</em>, the army that was come
                            to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against
                            Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the
                            valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;ten thousand&nbsp;<em>left</em>&nbsp;alive did the children
                            of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down
                            from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go
                            with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and
                            smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the
                            Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them
                            up&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and
                            burned incense unto them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Wherefore the anger of the Lord&nbsp;was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a
                            prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could
                            not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And it came to pass, as he talked with him,
                            that&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>king</em>&nbsp;said unto him, Art thou made of the
                            king&rsquo;s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and
                            said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast
                            not hearkened unto my counsel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of
                            Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the
                            face.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle
                            that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;in Lebanon sent to the cedar that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;in
                            Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast
                            that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to
                            boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to&nbsp;<em>thine</em>&nbsp;hurt, that
                            thou shouldest fall,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;thou, and Judah with thee?</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 But Amaziah would not hear; for it&nbsp;<em>came</em>&nbsp;of God, that he might deliver
                            them into the hand&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;<em>enemies</em>, because they
                            sought after the gods of Edom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the
                            face,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh,
                            which&nbsp;<em>belongeth</em>&nbsp;to Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his
                            tent.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of
                            Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of
                            Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>took</em>&nbsp;all the gold and the silver, and all the
                            vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the
                            king&rsquo;s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25&nbsp;&nbsp;And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son
                            of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;they
                            not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</span></p>
                    <p><span>27&nbsp;&nbsp;Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the
                            Lord&nbsp;they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they
                            sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of
                            Judah.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>THEN all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;sixteen years old, and
                            made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his
                            fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Sixteen years old&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned
                            fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother&rsquo;s name
                            also&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And he did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;right in the
                            sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah did.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God:
                            and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath,
                            and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
                            Philistines.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in
                            Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
                            abroad&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;to the entering in of Egypt; for he
                            strengthened&nbsp;<em>himself</em>&nbsp;exceedingly.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and
                            at the turning&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>wall</em>, and fortified
                            them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both
                            in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen&nbsp;<em>also</em>, and vine dressers in
                            the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to
                            the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under
                            the hand of Hananiah,&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;of the king&rsquo;s captains.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of
                            valour&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;two thousand and six hundred.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And under their hand&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;an army, three hundred thousand and seven
                            thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the
                            enemy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets,
                            and habergeons, and bows, and slings&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>cast</em>&nbsp;stones.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon
                            the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for
                            he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up
                            to&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;destruction: for he transgressed against the Lord&nbsp;his God,
                            and went into the temple of the Lord&nbsp;to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the
                            Lord,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;valiant men:</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto
                            him,&nbsp;<em>It</em>&nbsp;<em>appertaineth</em>&nbsp;not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense
                            unto the Lord, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense:
                            go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed;
                            neither&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>for thine honour from the
                            Lord&nbsp;God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;a censer in his hand to burn incense:
                            and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the
                            priests in the house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold,
                            he&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea,
                            himself hasted also to go out, because the Lord&nbsp;had smitten him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several
                            house,&nbsp;<em>being</em>&nbsp;a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord: and
                            Jotham his son&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;over the king&rsquo;s house, judging the people of the
                            land.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet,
                            the son of Amoz, write.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of
                            the burial which&nbsp;<em>belonged</em>&nbsp;to the kings; for they said,
                            He&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>

                            measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto
                            him, both the second year, and the third.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the Lord&nbsp;his
                            God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David:
                            and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AHAZ&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen
                            years in Jerusalem: but he did
                            not&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;right in the sight of the
                            Lord, like David his father:</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for
                            Baalim.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in
                            the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord&nbsp;had cast out before the
                            children of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under
                            every green tree.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Wherefore the Lord&nbsp;his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and
                            they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and
                            brought&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the
                            king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in
                            one day,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;all valiant men; because they had
                            forsaken the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king&rsquo;s son, and Azrikam the
                            governor of the house, and Elkanah&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;next to the
                            king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand,
                            women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil
                            to Samaria.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 But a prophet of the Lord&nbsp;was there, whose name&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Oded: and he
                            went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand,
                            and ye have slain them in a rage&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;reacheth up unto heaven.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and
                            bondwomen unto you:&nbsp;<em>but</em>&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;not with
                            you, even with you, sins against the Lord&nbsp;your God?</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of
                            your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the Lord&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;upon you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan,
                            Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of
                            Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have
                            offended against the Lord&nbsp;<em>already</em>, ye intend to add&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;to
                            our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great,
                            and&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;fierce wrath against Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the
                            congregation.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the
                            spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them
                            to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and
                            brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to
                            Samaria.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>17 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of
                            Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
                            thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they
                            dwelt there.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 For the Lord&nbsp;brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah
                            naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened
                            him not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 For Ahaz took away a portion&nbsp;<em>out</em>&nbsp;of the house of the Lord,
                            and&nbsp;<em>out</em>&nbsp;of the house of the king, and of the princes, and
                            gave&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord:
                            this&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;king Ahaz.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the
                            gods of the kings of Syria help them,&nbsp;<em>therefore</em>&nbsp;will I sacrifice to them,
                            that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the
                            vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord, and he made him
                            altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods,
                            and provoked to anger the Lord&nbsp;God of his fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
                            city,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of
                            the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>HEZEKIAH began to reign&nbsp;<em>when</em>&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;five and
                            twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s
                            name&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And he did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;right in the
                            sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the
                            house of the Lord, and repaired them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east
                            street,</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house
                            of the Lord&nbsp;God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the
                            holy&nbsp;<em>place</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 For our fathers have trespassed, and
                            done&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;evil in the eyes of the
                            Lord&nbsp;our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the
                            habitation of the Lord, and turned&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;backs.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned
                            incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy&nbsp;<em>place</em>&nbsp;unto the God of
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Wherefore the wrath of the Lord&nbsp;was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered
                            them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our
                            wives&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in captivity for this.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Now&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in mine heart to make a covenant with the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 My sons, be not now negligent: for the Lord&nbsp;hath chosen you to stand before him, to
                            serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of
                            Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and
                            Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the
                            son of Joah:</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah,
                            and Mattaniah:</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and
                            Uzziel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the
                            commandment of the king, by the words of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord, to
                            cleanse&nbsp;<em>it</em>, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple
                            of the Lord&nbsp;into the court of the house of the Lord. And the Levites
                            took&nbsp;<em>it</em>, to carry&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;out abroad into the brook
                            Kidron.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Now they began on the first&nbsp;<em>day</em>&nbsp;of the first month to sanctify, and
                            on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord: so they sanctified the
                            house of the Lord&nbsp;in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made
                            an end.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the
                            Lord, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
                            table, with all the vessels thereof.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his
                            transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;before the altar of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and
                            went up to the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats,
                            for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded
                            the priests the sons of Aaron to offer&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;on the altar of the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and
                            sprinkled&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they
                            sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood
                            upon the altar.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And they brought forth the he goats&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;the sin offering before the
                            king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the
                            altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king
                            commanded&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;the burnt offering and the sin
                            offering&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;<em>made</em>&nbsp;for all
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord&nbsp;with cymbals, with psalteries, and
                            with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king&rsquo;s seer, and
                            Nathan the prophet: for&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the commandment of the
                            Lord&nbsp;by his prophets.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the
                            trumpets.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt
                            offering began, the song of the Lord&nbsp;began&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;with the trumpets,
                            and with the instruments&nbsp;<em>ordained</em>&nbsp;by David king of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters
                            sounded:&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;all&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;<em>continued</em>&nbsp;until
                            the burnt offering was finished.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him
                            bowed themselves, and worshipped.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the
                            Lord&nbsp;with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with
                            gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the Lord, come
                            near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the Lord. And the
                            congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart
                            burnt offerings.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore
                            and ten bullocks, an hundred rams,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;two hundred lambs: all
                            these&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;for a burnt offering to the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And the consecrated things&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;six hundred oxen and three thousand
                            sheep.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings:
                            wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until
                            the&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;priests had sanctified themselves: for the
                            Levites&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the
                            priests.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35 And also the burnt offerings&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in abundance, with the fat of the
                            peace offerings, and the drink offerings for&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;burnt offering. So the
                            service of the house of the Lord&nbsp;was set in order.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the
                            thing was&nbsp;<em>done</em>&nbsp;suddenly.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>AND Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh,
                            that they should come to the house of the Lord&nbsp;at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto
                            the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem,
                            to keep the passover in the second month.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified
                            themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba
                            even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel at
                            Jerusalem: for they had not done&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;of a
                            long&nbsp;<em>time</em>&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;<em>such</em>&nbsp;<em>sort</em>&nbsp;as it
                            was written.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel
                            and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
                            again unto the Lord&nbsp;God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the
                            remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers,&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;therefore gave them up to desolation,
                            as ye see.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your
                            fathers&nbsp;<em>were</em>,&nbsp;<em>but</em>&nbsp;yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter
                            into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord&nbsp;your God,
                            that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your
                            children&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>find</em>&nbsp;compassion before them that lead them
                            captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord&nbsp;your
                            God&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;gracious and merciful, and will not turn
                            away&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;face from you, if ye return unto him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even
                            unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the
                            king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened
                            bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And they arose and took away the altars that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in Jerusalem, and
                            all the altars for incense took they away, and cast&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;into the brook
                            Kidron.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth&nbsp;<em>day</em>&nbsp;of the second
                            month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought
                            in the burnt offerings into the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man
                            of God: the priests sprinkled the
                            blood,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;<em>received</em>&nbsp;of the hand of the
                            Levites.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 For&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;many in the congregation that were not
                            sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every
                            one&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;not clean, to
                            sanctify&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;unto the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 For a multitude of the people,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;many of Ephraim, and Manasseh,
                            Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise
                            than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good Lord&nbsp;pardon every
                            one</span></p>
                    <p><span>19&nbsp;<em>That</em>&nbsp;prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord&nbsp;God of his
                            fathers,
                            though&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;not&nbsp;<em>cleansed</em>&nbsp;according to
                            the purification of the sanctuary.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And the Lord&nbsp;hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened
                            bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the
                            Lord&nbsp;day by day,&nbsp;<em>singing</em>&nbsp;with loud instruments unto the Lord.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>22 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of
                            the Lord: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
                            making confession to the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they
                            kept&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;seven days with gladness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven
                            thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten
                            thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the
                            congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel,
                            and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king
                            of Israel&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;not the like in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice
                            was heard, and their prayer came&nbsp;<em>up</em>&nbsp;to his holy dwelling
                            place,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;unto heaven.</span></p>

                    <p><span>NOW when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of
                            Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high
                            places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until
                            they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to

                    <p><span>2&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their

                            for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the

                    <p><span>3&nbsp;<em>He</em>&nbsp;<em>appointed</em>&nbsp;also the king&rsquo;s portion of his

                            evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons,
                            and for the set feasts, as&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;written in the law of the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the
                            priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in
                            abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the
                            field; and the tithe of all&nbsp;<em>things</em>&nbsp;brought they in abundantly.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And&nbsp;<em>concerning</em>&nbsp;the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the
                            cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy
                            things which were consecrated unto the Lord&nbsp;their God, and
                            laid&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;by heaps.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and
                            finished&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;in the seventh month.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the Lord, and his

                    <p><span>9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</span>

                    <p><span>10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said,

                            house of the Lord, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the Lord&nbsp;hath
                            blessed his people; and that which is left&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;this great store.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the Lord; and
                            they prepared&nbsp;<em>them</em>,</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the
                            dedicated&nbsp;<em>things</em>&nbsp;faithfully: over which Cononiah the
                            Levite&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;ruler, and Shimei his brother&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the

                    <p><span>17 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from
                            twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their
                            daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves
                            in holiness:</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in
                            the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were
                            expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were
                            reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and
                            wrought&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;good and right and
                            truth before the Lord&nbsp;his God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and
                            in the commandments, to seek his God, he did&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;with all his heart, and
                            prospered.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>AFTER these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and
                            entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
                            himself.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight
                            against Jerusalem,</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains
                            which&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;without the city: and they did help him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook
                            that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and
                            find much water?</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and
                            raised&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired
                            Millo&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;the city of David, and made darts and shields in
                            abundance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the
                            street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all
                            the multitude that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;with him:
                            for&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;more with us than with him:</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 With him&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;an arm of flesh; but with us&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the
                            Lord&nbsp;our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves
                            upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem,
                            (but he&nbsp;<em>himself</em>&nbsp;<em>laid</em>&nbsp;<em>siege</em>&nbsp;against Lachish,
                            and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah
                            that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;at Jerusalem, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege
                            in Jerusalem?</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst,
                            saying, The Lord&nbsp;our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of
                            Assyria?</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded
                            Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon
                            it?</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people
                            of&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able
                            to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Who&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;among all the gods of those nations that
                            my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God
                            should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet
                            believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine
                            hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of
                            mine hand?</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And his servants spake yet&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;against the Lord&nbsp;God, and
                            against his servant Hezekiah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 He wrote also letters to rail on the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, and to speak against him,
                            saying, As the gods of the nations of&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;lands have not delivered
                            their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of
                            mine hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews&rsquo; speech unto the people of Jerusalem
                            that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they
                            might take the city.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the
                            earth,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;the work of the hands of man.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And for this&nbsp;<em>cause</em>&nbsp;Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son
                            of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord&nbsp;sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour,
                            and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame
                            of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came
                            forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Thus the Lord&nbsp;saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of
                            Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all&nbsp;<em>other</em>, and guided
                            them on every side.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And many brought gifts unto the Lord&nbsp;to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of
                            Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the Lord: and
                            he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit&nbsp;<em>done</em>&nbsp;unto
                            him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
                            heart,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the
                            Lord&nbsp;came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself
                            treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for
                            shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner
                            of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for
                            God had given him substance very much.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight
                            down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>31&nbsp;&nbsp;Howbeit in&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>business</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;the
                            ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that
                            was&nbsp;<em>done</em>&nbsp;in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
                            all&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;in his heart.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of
                            Amoz,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the
                            sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him
                            honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>MANASSEH&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
                            fifty and five years in Jerusalem:</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 But did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;evil in the sight
                            of the Lord, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord&nbsp;had cast out
                            before the children of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down,
                            and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven,
                            and served them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Also he built altars in the house of the Lord, whereof the Lord&nbsp;had said, In
                            Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom:
                            also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a
                            familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke
                            him to anger.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God
                            had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have
                            chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have
                            appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded
                            them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of
                            Moses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to
                            do worse than the heathen, whom the Lord&nbsp;had destroyed before the children of
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And the Lord&nbsp;spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not
                            hearken.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore the Lord&nbsp;brought upon them the captains of the host of the
                            king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and
                            carried him to Babylon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord&nbsp;his God, and humbled himself
                            greatly before the God of his fathers,</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and
                            brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the
                            Lord&nbsp;he&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in
                            the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised
                            it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the Lord, and all
                            the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and
                            cast&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;out of the city.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank
                            offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high
                            places,&nbsp;<em>yet</em>&nbsp;unto the Lord&nbsp;their God only.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the
                            words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, behold,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;<em>written</em>&nbsp;in the book of the kings of Israel.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>19 His prayer also, and&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;<em>God</em>&nbsp;was intreated of him, and
                            all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up
                            groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written
                            among the sayings of the seers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and
                            Amon his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21&nbsp;&nbsp;Amon&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;two and twenty years old when he began to reign,
                            and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 But he did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;evil in the
                            sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved
                            images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And humbled not himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but
                            Amon trespassed more and more.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25&nbsp;&nbsp;But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king
                            Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>JOSIAH&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in
                            Jerusalem one and thirty years.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And he did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;right in the
                            sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and
                            declined&nbsp;<em>neither</em>&nbsp;to the right hand, nor to the left.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek
                            after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and
                            Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten
                            images.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images,
                            that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved
                            images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made
                            dust&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>them</em>, and strowed&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;upon the graves
                            of them that had sacrificed unto them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And&nbsp;<em>so</em>&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;in the cities of Manasseh,
                            and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images
                            into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the
                            house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah
                            the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord&nbsp;his God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought
                            into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
                            Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and
                            they returned to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And they put&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of
                            the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the
                            Lord, to repair and amend the house:</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they&nbsp;<em>it</em>, to buy hewn stone, and
                            timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>12 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of
                            them&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and
                            Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
                            set&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;forward; and&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;the
                            Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Also&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;over the bearers of burdens,
                            and&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service:
                            and of the Levites&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;scribes, and officers, and
                            porters.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the
                            Lord, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord&nbsp;<em>given</em>&nbsp;by
                            Moses.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in
                            the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying,
                            All that was committed to thy servants, they do&nbsp;<em>it</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and
                            have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book.
                            And Shaphan read it before the king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his
                            clothes.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of
                            Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king&rsquo;s, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 Go, inquire of the Lord&nbsp;for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah,
                            concerning the words of the book that is found: for great&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the wrath of
                            the Lord&nbsp;that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
                            Lord, to do after all that is written in this book.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And Hilkiah, and&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;that the
                            king&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;<em>appointed</em>, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
                            Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
                            Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that&nbsp;<em>effect</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23&nbsp;&nbsp;And she answered them, Thus saith the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel, Tell ye the
                            man that sent you to me,</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants
                            thereof,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;all the curses that are written in the book which they have
                            read before the king of Judah:</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might
                            provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured
                            out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, so shall ye say unto
                            him, Thus saith the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel&nbsp;<em>concerning</em>&nbsp;the words which
                            thou hast heard;</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou
                            heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst
                            thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even
                            heard&nbsp;<em>thee</em>also, saith the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in
                            peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon
                            the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and the
                            inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and
                            small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in
                            the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the
                            Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his
                            heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this
                            book.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
                            stand&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to
                            the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries
                            that&nbsp;<em>pertained</em>&nbsp;to the children of Israel, and made all that were present
                            in Israel to serve,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;to serve the Lord&nbsp;their
                            God.&nbsp;<em>And</em>&nbsp;all his days they departed not from following the Lord, the God
                            of their fathers.</span></p>

                    <p><span>14 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests

                            the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king&rsquo;s seer; and the
                            porters&nbsp;<em>waited</em>&nbsp;at every gate; they might not depart from their service;
                            for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 So all the service of the Lord&nbsp;was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and
                            to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king
                            Josiah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the
                            feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the
                            prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the
                            priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came
                            up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of
                            Judah?&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;<em>come</em>&nbsp;not against thee this day, but against the
                            house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee
                            from&nbsp;<em>meddling</em>&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;God, who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;with me,
                            that he destroy thee not.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he
                            might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and
                            came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away;
                            for I am sore wounded.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot
                            that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried
                            in&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and
                            Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing
                            women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in
                            Israel: and, behold, they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the lamentations.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according
                            to&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;written in the law of the
                            Lord,</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the book
                            of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>THEN the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his
                            father&rsquo;s stead in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Jehoahaz&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he
                            reigned three months in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred
                            talents of silver and a talent of gold.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned
                            his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehoiakim&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;twenty and five years old when he began to
                            reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he
                            did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;evil in the sight of the
                            Lord&nbsp;his God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry
                            him to Babylon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord&nbsp;to Babylon, and
                            put them in his temple at Babylon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which
                            was found in him, behold, they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the book of the kings of
                            Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehoiachin&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;eight years old when he began to reign, and
                            he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he
                            did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;evil in the sight of the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon,
                            with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Zedekiah his brother king over
                            Judah and Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Zedekiah&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;one and twenty years old when he began to
                            reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And he did&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;evil in the
                            sight of the Lord&nbsp;his God,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;humbled not himself before Jeremiah
                            the prophet&nbsp;<em>speaking</em>&nbsp;from the mouth of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he
                            stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord&nbsp;God of
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much
                            after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the Lord&nbsp;which he
                            had hallowed in Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up
                            betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling
                            place:</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets,
                            until the wrath of the Lord&nbsp;arose against his people,
                            till&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;no remedy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with
                            the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden,
                            old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;all into his
                            hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house
                            of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes;
                            all&nbsp;<em>these</em>&nbsp;he brought to Babylon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the
                            palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were
                            servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 To fulfil the word of the Lord&nbsp;by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed
                            her sabbaths:&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil
                            threescore and ten years.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the
                            Lord&nbsp;<em>spoken</em>&nbsp;by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the
                            Lord&nbsp;stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation
                            throughout all his kingdom, and&nbsp;<em>put</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;also in writing,
                            saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord&nbsp;God of
                            heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem,
                            which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in Judah. Who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;among
                            you of all his people? The Lord&nbsp;his God&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with him, and let him go
                            up.</span></p>
