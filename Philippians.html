                    <p>PAUL and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in
                        Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jesus which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>are at Philippi, with the
                        bishops and deacons:</p>
                    <p>2 Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto you, and peace, from God our Father,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</p>
                    <p>4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</p>
                    <p>5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</p>
                    <p>6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will
                        perform<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>until the day of Jesus Christ:</p>
                    <p>7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as
                        both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my
                        grace.</p>
                    <p>8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all judgment<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till
                        the day of Christ;</p>
                    <p>11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and
                        praise of God.</p>
                    <p>12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>happened</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                        me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</p>
                    <p>13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all
                        other<span>&nbsp;</span><em>places;</em></p>
                    <p>14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to
                        speak the word without fear.</p>
                    <p>15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</p>
                    <p>16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
                    </p>
                    <p>17 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</p>
                    <p>18 What then?<span>&nbsp;</span><span>notwithstanding</span>, every way, whether in pretence, or
                        in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
                    <p>19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the
                        Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
                    <p>20 According to my earnest expectation and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hope,
                        that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        all boldness, as always,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>now also Christ shall
                        be magnified in my body,
                        whether<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>be</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>by
                        life, or by death.</p>
                    <p>21 For to me to live<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Christ, and to
                        die<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gain.</p>
                    <p>22 But if I live in the flesh, this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the fruit of
                        my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</p>
                    <p>23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with
                        Christ<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>which is far better:</p>
                    <p>24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>more
                        needful for you.</p>
                    <p>25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your
                        furtherance and joy of faith<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>26 That<span>&nbsp;</span><span>your</span><span>&nbsp;</span>rejoicing may be more abundant in
                        Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</p>
                    <p>27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see
                        you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one
                        mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</p>
                    <p>28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition,
                        but to you of salvation, and that of God.</p>
                    <p>29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to
                        suffer for his sake<span>;</span></p>
                    <p>30 Having the same<span>&nbsp;</span><span>conflict which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>ye saw in me,
                        and now hear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        me.</p>

                        love,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of one accord, of one mind.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing<span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>be</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>done</em><span>&nbsp;</span>through

                    <p>4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</p>
                    <p>5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
                    <p>6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><span>God:</span></p>
                    <p>7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
                        likeness of men:</p>
                    <p>8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even
                        the death of the cross.</p>
                    <p>9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</p>
                    <p>10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in heaven,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in earth,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under the earth;</p>
                    <p>11 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>every tongue should confess that Jesus
                        Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
                    <p>12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more
                        in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
                    <p>13 For it<span>&nbsp;</span><span>is</span><span>&nbsp;</span>God which worketh in you both to
                        will and to do of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good pleasure.</p>
                    <p>14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</p>
                    <p>15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a
                        crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</p>
                    <p>16 Holding forth the word of life<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>that I may rejoice in the day
                        of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</p>
                    <p>17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with
                        you all.</p>
                    <p>18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</p>
                    <p>19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good
                        comfort, when I know your state.</p>
                    <p>20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</p>
                    <p>21 For all seek<span>&nbsp;</span><span>their</span><span>&nbsp;</span>own, not the things which
                        are Jesus Christ&rsquo;s.</p>
                    <p>22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the
                        gospel.</p>
                    <p>23 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</p>
                    <p>24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</p>
                    <p>25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour,
                        and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</p>
                    <p>26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had
                        been sick.</p>
                    <p>27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on
                        me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
                    <p>28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that
                        I may be the less sorrowful.</p>
                    <p>29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</p>
                    <p>30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your
                        lack of service toward me.</p>

                    <p>3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and
                        have no confidence in the flesh.</p>
                    <p>4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath
                        whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</p>
                    <p>5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of
                        Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the tribe of
                        Benjamin,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>an</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching
                        the law, a Pharisee;</p>
                    <p>6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>righteousness
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>is in the law, blameless.</p>
                    <p>7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</p>
                    <p>8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>loss for
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>excellency</span><span>&nbsp;</span>of the knowledge of Christ Jesus
                        my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count
                        them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dung, that I may win Christ,</p>
                    <p>9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
                        through the faith of Christ, the
                        righteousness<span>&nbsp;</span><span>which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>is of God by faith:</p>
                    <p>10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
                        being made conformable unto his death;</p>
                    <p>11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.</p>
                    <p>12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that
                        I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</p>
                    <p>13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended:
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>one
                        thing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em>, forgetting
                        those<span>&nbsp;</span><span>things which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>are behind, and reaching
                        forth unto those things which are before,</p>
                    <p>14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
                    <p>15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing
                        ye<span>&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;</span>otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
                        this unto you.</p>
                    <p>16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the
                        same thing.</p>
                    <p>17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an
                        ensample.</p>
                    <p>18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
                        weeping,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        enemies of the cross of Christ:</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Whose</span><span>&nbsp;</span>end<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>destruction,
                        whose
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>belly,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>whose</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        their shame, who mind earthly things.)</p>
                    <p>20 For our conversation is in heaven<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>from whence also we look for
                        the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
                    <p>21 Who shall change our vile<span>&nbsp;</span><span>body, that</span><span>&nbsp;</span>it may
                        be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to
                        subdue all things unto himself.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THEREFORE, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dearly beloved.</p>
                    <p>2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;</span>of the same mind in the Lord.</p>
                    <p>3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those<span>&nbsp;</span><span>women
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>other my fellowlabourers, whose
                        names<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the book of life.</p>
                    <p>4 Rejoice in the Lord alway:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>again I
                        say,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Rejoice</span>.</p>
                    <p>5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at hand.</p>
                    <p>6 Be careful for nothing<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>but in every thing by prayer and
                        supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</p>
                    <p>7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
                        Christ Jesus.</p>
                    <p>8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>honest, whatsoever
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>just, whatsoever
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pure, whatsoever
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lovely, whatsoever
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of good report;
                        if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>any virtue,
                        and if<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>any
                        praise, think on these things.</p>
                    <p>9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the
                        God of peace shall be with you.</p>
                    <p>10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished
                        again<span>;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p>11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I
                        am,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>therewith</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to be content.</p>
                    <p>12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound:<span>&nbsp;</span><span>every
                            where</span><span>&nbsp;</span>and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be
                        hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>
                    <p>13 I can do all things through<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Christ
                            which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>strengtheneth me.</p>
                    <p>14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</p>
                    <p>15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from
                        Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</p>
                    <p>16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</p>
                    <p>17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</p>
                    <p>18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>sent</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from
                        you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</p>
                    <p>19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p>
                    <p>20 Now unto God and our Father<span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>be</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>glory
                        for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
                    <p>21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The
                        brethren<span>&nbsp;</span><span>which</span><span>&nbsp;</span>are with me greet you.</p>
                    <p>22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s household.</p>
                    <p>23 The grace of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><span><em>be</em></span><span>&nbsp;</span>with you all. Amen.</p>
