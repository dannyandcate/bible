                    <p>THE song of songs, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Solomon&rsquo;s.</p>
                    <p>2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy
                        love<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than wine.</p>
                    <p>3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy
                        name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ointment
                        poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</p>
                    <p>4 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad
                        and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</p>
                    <p>5 I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>black, but comely, O ye daughters of
                        Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
                    <p>6 Look not upon me, because I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>black, because the
                        sun hath looked upon me: my mother&rsquo;s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper
                        of the vineyards;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine own vineyard have I not
                        kept.</p>
                    <p>7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou
                        makest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>flock</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to rest
                        at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the
                        footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds&rsquo; tents.</p>
                    <p>9 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots.</p>
                    <p>10 Thy cheeks are comely with

                    <p>4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over

                        sister,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain

                    <p>13 Thy plants<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an orchard of pomegranates, with

                    <p>14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes,
                        with all the chief spices:</p>
                    <p>15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my

                    <p>I AM come into my garden, my sister,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>spouse: I

                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I sleep, but my heart
                        waketh:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the voice
                        of my beloved that knocketh,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Open to me, my sister, my love,
                        my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with
                        dew,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my locks with the drops of the night.</p>
                    <p>3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
                    </p>
                    <p>4 My beloved put in his hand by the

                        and my bowels were moved for him.</p>
                    <p>5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands
                        dropped<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>myrrh, and my
                        fingers<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles
                        of the lock.</p>
                    <p>6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn
                        himself,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>was gone: my soul failed when he
                        spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</p>
                    <p>7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of
                        the walls took away my veil from me.</p>
                    <p>8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that

                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>16 His mouth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>most sweet: yea,

                        forth: there she brought thee forth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bare thee.
                    </p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for
                        love<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>strong as death;
                        jealousy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cruel as the grave: the coals
                        thereof<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>coals of
                        fire,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a most
                        vehement flame.</p>
                    <p>7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the
                        substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for
                        our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</p>
                    <p>9 If she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a wall, we will build upon her a palace
                        of silver: and if she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a door, we will inclose
                        her with boards of cedar.</p>
                    <p>10 I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was
                        I in his eyes as one that found favour.</p>
                    <p>11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the
                        fruit thereof was to bring a thousand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pieces</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        silver.</p>
                    <p>12 My vineyard,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mine,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before
                        me: thou, O
                        Solomon,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>must</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</p>
                    <p>13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to
                        hear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart
                        upon the mountains of spices.</p>
