                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>HOW doth the city sit
                        solitary,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>full
                        of people!<span>&nbsp;</span><em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is she become as a widow!
                        she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great among
                        the nations,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>princess among the
                        provinces,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is she become tributary!</p>
                    <p>2 She weepeth sore in the night, and her
                        tears<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on her cheeks: among all her lovers she
                        hath none to comfort<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all her friends have
                        dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</p>
                    <p>3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she
                        dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the
                        straits.</p>
                    <p>4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate:
                        her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and
                        she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in bitterness.</p>
                    <p>5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath
                        afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity
                        before the enemy.</p>
                    <p>6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like
                        harts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>find no pasture, and they are gone
                        without strength before the pursuer.</p>
                    <p>7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things
                        that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did
                        help her: the adversaries saw her,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>did mock at
                        her sabbaths.</p>
                    <p>8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her,
                        because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</p>
                    <p>9 Her filthiness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in her skirts; she remembereth
                        not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O Lord, behold my
                        affliction: for the enemy hath magnified<span>&nbsp;</span><em>himself</em>.</p>
                    <p>10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath
                        seen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the heathen entered into her sanctuary,
                        whom thou didst command<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they should not enter
                        into thy congregation.</p>
                    <p>11 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to
                        relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider; for I am become vile.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing to
                        you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is
                        done unto me, wherewith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath
                        afflicted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the day of his fierce anger.</p>
                    <p>13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a
                        net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me
                        desolate<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>faint all the day.</p>
                    <p>14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
                        wreathed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>come up upon my neck: he hath made my
                        strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me
                        into<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hands,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>whom</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                        am not able to rise up.</p>
                    <p>15 The Lord hath trodden under foot all my
                        mighty<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst of me: he hath called an
                        assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of
                        Judah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in a winepress.</p>
                    <p>16 For these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I weep; mine eye, mine eye
                        runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my
                        children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</p>
                    <p>17 Zion spreadeth forth her
                        hands,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                        to comfort her: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath commanded concerning
                        Jacob,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                        adversaries<span>&nbsp;</span><em>should</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>round
                        about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>is righteous; for I have rebelled against
                        his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men
                        are gone into captivity.</p>
                    <p>19 I called for my lovers,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they deceived me: my
                        priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve
                        their souls.</p>
                    <p>20 Behold, O Lord; for I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in distress: my bowels
                        are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword
                        bereaveth, at
                        home<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as death.
                    </p>
                    <p>21 They have heard that I
                        sigh:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none to
                        comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast
                        done<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou wilt bring the
                        day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast called, and they shall be like
                        unto me.</p>
                    <p>22 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all
                        my transgressions: for my sighs<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>many, and my
                        heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>faint.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>HOW hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
                        anger,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cast down from heaven unto the earth the
                        beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</p>
                    <p>2 The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown
                        down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath
                        brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>down to the ground: he hath polluted
                        the kingdom and the princes thereof.</p>
                    <p>3 He hath cut off in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fierce anger all the horn
                        of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob
                        like a flaming fire,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>devoureth round about.
                    </p>
                    <p>4 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pleasant
                        to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</p>
                    <p>5 The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he
                        hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and
                        lamentation.</p>
                    <p>6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath caused the
                        solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his
                        anger the king and the priest.</p>
                    <p>7 The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the
                        hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the Lord, as
                        in the day of a solemn feast.</p>
                    <p>8 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath
                        stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the
                        rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</p>
                    <p>9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her
                        princes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among the Gentiles: the
                        law<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no<span>&nbsp;</span><em>more;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>her
                        prophets also find no vision from the Lord.</p>
                    <p>10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the
                        ground,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>keep silence: they have cast up dust
                        upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down
                        their heads to the ground.</p>
                    <p>11 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for
                        the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in
                        the streets of the city.</p>
                    <p>12 They say to their mothers, Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>corn and
                        wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured
                        out into their mothers&rsquo; bosom.</p>
                    <p>13 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of
                        Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for
                        thy breach<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great like the sea: who can heal
                        thee?</p>
                    <p>14 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine
                        iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of
                        banishment.</p>
                    <p>15 All that pass by clap<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hands at thee; they
                        hiss and wag their head at the daughter of
                        Jerusalem,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this
                        the city that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>call The perfection of beauty,
                        The joy of the whole earth?</p>
                    <p>16 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they
                        say, We have swallowed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up: certainly
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the day that we looked for; we have found,
                        we have seen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>17 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath done<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which
                        he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath
                        thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath
                        caused<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thine</em><span>&nbsp;</span>enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath
                        set up the horn of thine adversaries.</p>
                    <p>18 Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a
                        river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</p>
                    <p>19 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water
                        before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children,
                        that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the
                        women eat their fruit,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>children of a span long?
                        shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</p>
                    <p>21 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen
                        by the sword; thou hast slain<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the day of
                        thine anger; thou hast killed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not pitied.</p>
                    <p>22 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the
                        Lord&rsquo;s anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath

                    <p>I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>AM</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hath seen affliction by the rod of his
                        wrath.</p>
                    <p>2 He hath led me, and
                        brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>into</em><span>&nbsp;</span>darkness,
                        but not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>into</em><span>&nbsp;</span>light.</p>
                    <p>3 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his

                        day.</p>
                    <p>4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</p>
                    <p>5 He hath builded against me, and compassed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        gall and travail.</p>
                    <p>6 He hath set me in dark places,

                    <p>7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</p>
                    <p>8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</p>
                    <p>9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</p>
                    <p>10 He<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto

                    <p>11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</p>
                    <p>12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>
                    <p>13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</p>
                    <p>14 I was a derision to all my people;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their song
                        all the day.</p>
                    <p>15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</p>
                    <p>16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.</p>
                    <p>17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.</p>
                    <p>18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord:</p>

                    <p>21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</p>

                        hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>27<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good for a man
                        that he bear the yoke in his youth.</p>
                    <p>28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath
                        borne<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon him.</p>
                    <p>29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</p>
                    <p>30 He giveth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cheek to him that smiteth him: he
                        is filled full with reproach.</p>
                    <p>31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever:</p>
                    <p>32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his
                        mercies.</p>
                    <p>33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</p>
                    <p>34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</p>
                    <p>35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</p>
                    <p>36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.</p>
                    <p>37<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>saith,
                        and it cometh to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord
                        commandeth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not?</p>
                    <p>38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?</p>
                    <p>39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>
                    <p>40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</p>
                    <p>41 Let us lift up our heart with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>our</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hands unto God
                        in the heavens.</p>
                    <p>42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.</p>
                    <p>43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</p>
                    <p>44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud,

                    <p>45 Thou hast made us<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the offscouring and refuse
                        in the midst of the people.</p>
                    <p>46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>
                    <p>47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.</p>
                    <p>48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
                    </p>
                    <p>49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</p>

                    <p>51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
                    <p>52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</p>
                    <p>53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.</p>
                    <p>54 Waters flowed over mine head;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I said, I am
                        cut off.</p>
                    <p>55<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.</p>
                    <p>56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</p>
                    <p>57 Thou drewest near in the day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I called upon
                        thee: thou saidst, Fear not.</p>
                    <p>58 O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</p>
                    <p>59 O Lord, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</p>
                    <p>60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all their

                    <p>61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all

                    <p>62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</p>
                    <p>63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up;

                    <p>7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body

                    <p>8 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to

                    <p>16 The anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they

                    <p>17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a

                    <p>18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are

                    <p>19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains,
                        they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits, of whom we
                        said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of

                    <p>6 We have given the hand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Egyptians,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</p>
                    <p>7 Our fathers have
                        sinned,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not; and
                        we have borne their iniquities.</p>
                    <p>8 Servants have ruled over
                        us:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none that
                        doth deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of their hand.</p>
                    <p>9 We gat our bread
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>peril</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our
                        lives because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.</p>
                    <p>11 They ravished the women in Zion,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the maids in
                        the cities of Judah.</p>
                    <p>12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.</p>
                    <p>13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.</p>
                    <p>14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.</p>
                    <p>15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.</p>
                    <p>16 The crown is fallen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our head: woe unto us,
                        that we have sinned!</p>
                    <p>17 For this our heart is faint; for these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our
                        eyes are dim.</p>
                    <p>18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.</p>
                    <p>19 Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.</p>
                    <p>20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for
                        ever,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forsake us so long time?</p>
                    <p>21 Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</p>
                    <p>22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.</p>
