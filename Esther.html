                    <p>NOW it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus,
                        (this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even
                        unto Ethiopia,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>over</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an hundred and seven and twenty
                        provinces:)</p>
                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;</span><em>That</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on
                        the throne of his kingdom, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Shushan the
                        palace,</p>
                    <p>3 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the
                        power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the
                        provinces,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before him:</p>
                    <p>4 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many
                        days,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an hundred and fourscore days.</p>
                    <p>5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present
                        in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the
                        king&rsquo;s palace;</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Where</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>white,
                        green, and blue,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hangings</em>, fastened with cords of fine linen and
                        purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the
                        beds<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gold and
                        silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p>
                    <p>7 And they gave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>drink in vessels of gold, (the
                        vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of
                        the king.</p>
                    <p>8 And the drinking<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>according to the law; none
                        did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do
                        according to every man&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
                    <p>9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the
                        women<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the royal house
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belonged</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to king Ahasuerus.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he
                        commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven
                        chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p>
                    <p>11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the
                        princes her beauty: for she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fair to look on.
                    </p>
                    <p>12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king&rsquo;s commandment
                        by<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>chamberlains: therefore was the king very
                        wroth, and his anger burned in him.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
                        so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king&rsquo;s manner toward all that knew
                        law and judgment:</p>
                    <p>14 And the next unto him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Carshena, Shethar,
                        Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Memucan, the
                        seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king&rsquo;s
                        face,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p>
                    <p>15 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the
                        commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</p>
                    <p>16 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to
                        the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all the provinces of the king
                        Ahasuerus.</p>
                    <p>17 For<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>deed of the queen shall come abroad unto
                        all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported,
                        The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Likewise</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall the ladies of Persia and Media say
                        this day unto all the king&rsquo;s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen.
                        Thus<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>arise</em><span>&nbsp;</span>too
                        much contempt and wrath.</p>
                    <p>19 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among
                        the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before
                        king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</p>
                    <p>20 And when the king&rsquo;s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his
                        empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and
                        small.</p>
                    <p>21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of
                        Memucan:</p>
                    <p>22 For he sent letters into all the king&rsquo;s provinces, into every province according to the
                        writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in
                        his own house, and that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>should be published
                        according to the language of every people.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AFTER these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what
                        she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p>
                    <p>2 Then said the king&rsquo;s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins
                        sought for the king:</p>
                    <p>3 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather
                        together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the
                        custody of Hege the king&rsquo;s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for
                        purification be given<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em></p>
                    <p>4 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased
                        the king; and he did so.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>Now</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Shushan the palace there was a
                        certain Jew, whose name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Mordecai, the son of
                        Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p>
                    <p>6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with
                        Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p>
                    <p>7 And he brought up Hadassah, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>, Esther, his uncle&rsquo;s
                        daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the
                        maid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when
                        her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So it came to pass, when the king&rsquo;s commandment and his decree
                        was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody
                        of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king&rsquo;s house, to the custody of Hegai,
                        keeper of the women.</p>
                    <p>9 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her
                        things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven
                        maidens,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>meet
                        to be given her, out of the king&rsquo;s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the
                        best<span>&nbsp;</span><em>place</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the house of the women.</p>
                    <p>10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should
                        not shew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>11 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women&rsquo;s house, to know how Esther
                        did, and what should become of her.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now when every maid&rsquo;s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
                        after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the
                        days of their purifications
                        accomplished,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>wit</em>, six months with oil
                        of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>things for the purifying of the women;)
                    </p>
                    <p>13 Then thus came<span>&nbsp;</span><em>every</em><span>&nbsp;</span>maiden unto the king;
                        whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the
                        king&rsquo;s house.</p>
                    <p>14 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to
                        the custody of Shaashgaz, the king&rsquo;s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in
                        unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
                        Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required
                        nothing but what Hegai the king&rsquo;s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And
                        Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p>
                    <p>16 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of
                        his reign.</p>
                    <p>17 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight
                        more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen
                        instead of Vashti.</p>
                    <p>18 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
                        servants,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Esther&rsquo;s feast; and he made a
                        release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>
                    <p>19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the
                        king&rsquo;s gate.</p>
                    <p>20 Esther had not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shewed her kindred nor her
                        people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when
                        she was brought up with him.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king&rsquo;s gate, two of the
                        king&rsquo;s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and
                        sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
                    <p>22 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who
                        told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified
                        the king<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thereof</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Mordecai&rsquo;s name.</p>
                    <p>23 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged
                        on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</p>

                    <p>AFTER these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and
                        advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him.</p>
                    <p>2 And all the king&rsquo;s servants, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        the king&rsquo;s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning
                        him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>reverence.

                        king&rsquo;s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king&rsquo;s commandment?</p>
                    <p>4 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they
                        told Haman, to see whether Mordecai&rsquo;s matters would stand: for he had told them that
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a Jew.</p>
                    <p>5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of
                        wrath.</p>
                    <p>6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of
                        Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>throughout the whole kingdom of
                        Ahasuerus,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the people of Mordecai.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the first month, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>, the month
                        Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>,
                        the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to
                        month,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        twelfth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>month</em>, that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>, the month Adar.
                    </p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered
                        abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their
                        laws<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>diverse from all people; neither keep they
                        the king&rsquo;s laws: therefore it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not for the
                        king&rsquo;s profit to suffer them.</p>
                    <p>9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten
                        thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to
                        bring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into the king&rsquo;s treasuries.</p>
                    <p>10 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the
                        Agagite, the Jews&rsquo; enemy.</p>
                    <p>11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>given
                        to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</p>
                    <p>12 Then were the king&rsquo;s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there
                        was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king&rsquo;s lieutenants, and to
                        the governors that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>over every province, and to
                        the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>every people after their language; in the
                        name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king&rsquo;s ring.</p>
                    <p>13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king&rsquo;s provinces, to destroy, to kill,
                        and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one
                        day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the
                        thirteenth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the twelfth month,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the month Adar,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><em>take</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the spoil of them for a prey.
                    </p>
                    <p>14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all
                        people, that they should be ready against that day.</p>
                    <p>15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king&rsquo;s commandment, and the decree was given
                        in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
                        perplexed.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>WHEN Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with
                        ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</p>
                    <p>2 And came even before the king&rsquo;s gate: for
                        none<span>&nbsp;</span><em>might</em><span>&nbsp;</span>enter into the king&rsquo;s gate clothed
                        with sackcloth.</p>
                    <p>3 And in every province, whithersoever the king&rsquo;s commandment and his decree
                        came,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great
                        mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and
                        ashes.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So Esther&rsquo;s maids and her chamberlains came and
                        told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>her. Then was the queen exceedingly
                        grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but
                        he received<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not.</p>
                    <p>5 Then called Esther for Hatach,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                        king&rsquo;s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment
                        to Mordecai, to know what it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>, and why
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>.</p>
                    <p>6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before the king&rsquo;s gate.</p>
                    <p>7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman
                        had promised to pay to the king&rsquo;s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</p>
                    <p>8 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy
                        them, to shew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto Esther, and to
                        declare<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto her, and to charge her that she
                        should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for
                        her people.</p>
                    <p>9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
                        Mordecai;</p>
                    <p>11 All the king&rsquo;s servants, and the people of the king&rsquo;s provinces, do know, that
                        whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not
                        called,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>one law
                        of his to put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to death, except such to whom the
                        king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in
                        unto the king these thirty days.</p>
                    <p>12 And they told to Mordecai Esther&rsquo;s words.</p>
                    <p>13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the
                        king&rsquo;s house, more than all the Jews.</p>
                    <p>14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this
                        time,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall there enlargement and deliverance
                        arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father&rsquo;s house shall be destroyed:
                        and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>such</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a time as this?</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then Esther
                        bade<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>return
                        Mordecai<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>answer</em>,</p>
                    <p>16 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither
                        eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I
                        go in unto the king, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not according to the
                        law: and if I perish, I perish.</p>
                    <p>17 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put
                        on<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>royal<span>&nbsp;</span><em>apparel</em>,
                        and stood in the inner court of the king&rsquo;s house, over against the king&rsquo;s house: and
                        the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</p>
                    <p>2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
                        court,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she obtained favour in his sight: and
                        the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his hand. So Esther drew near, and
                        touched the top of the sceptre.</p>
                    <p>3 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy request? it shall be even given thee to
                        the half of the kingdom.</p>
                    <p>4 And Esther answered,
                        If<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>seem</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good unto the
                        king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</p>
                    <p>5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king
                        and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy petition? and it shall be granted thee:
                        and what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy request? even to the half of the
                        kingdom it shall be performed.</p>
                    <p>7 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is;</em></p>
                    <p>8 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my
                        petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall
                        prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when
                        Haman saw Mordecai in the king&rsquo;s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was
                        full of indignation against Mordecai.</p>
                    <p>10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his
                        friends, and Zeresh his wife.</p>
                    <p>11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wherein
                        the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the
                        king.</p>
                    <p>12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the
                        banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the
                        king.</p>
                    <p>13 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the
                        king&rsquo;s gate.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows
                        be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged
                        thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman;
                        and he caused the gallows to be made.</p>

                    <p>ON that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the
                        chronicles; and they were read before the king.</p>
                    <p>2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the
                        king&rsquo;s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king
                        Ahasuerus.</p>
                    <p>3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the
                        king&rsquo;s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</p>

                        outward court of the king&rsquo;s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows
                        that he had prepared for him.</p>
                    <p>5 And the king&rsquo;s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king
                        said, Let him come in.</p>
                    <p>6 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king
                        delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do
                        honour more than to myself?</p>
                    <p>7 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,</p>
                    <p>8 Let the royal apparel be brought which the
                        king<span>&nbsp;</span><em>useth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to wear, and the horse that the king

                    <p>9 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king&rsquo;s most noble
                        princes, that they may array the man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>withal</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whom
                        the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and
                        proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
                    <p>10 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>take
                        the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth
                        at the king&rsquo;s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</p>
                    <p>11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback
                        through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man
                        whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Mordecai came again to the king&rsquo;s gate. But Haman hasted to
                        his house mourning, and having his head covered.</p>
                    <p>13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends
                        every<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that had befallen him. Then said his
                        wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If
                        Mordecai<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the seed of the Jews, before whom
                        thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
                    </p>
                    <p>14 And while they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet talking with him, came
                        the king&rsquo;s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had
                        prepared.</p>

                    <p>SO the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</p>
                    <p>2 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be
                        granted thee: and what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy request? and it shall
                        be performed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the half of the kingdom.</p>
                    <p>3 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it
                        please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</p>
                    <p>4 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had
                        been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not
                        countervail the king&rsquo;s damage.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is
                        he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</p>
                    <p>6 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this
                        wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his
                        wrath<span>&nbsp;</span><em>went</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into the palace garden: and Haman stood
                        up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined
                        against him by the king.</p>
                    <p>8 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and
                        Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>. Then said the king,
                        Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king&rsquo;s
                        mouth, they covered Haman&rsquo;s face.</p>
                    <p>9 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty
                        cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in
                        the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</p>
                    <p>10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the
                        king&rsquo;s wrath pacified.</p>

                    <p>ON that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews&rsquo; enemy unto Esther the
                        queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto her.</p>
                    <p>2 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And
                        Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet,
                        and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that
                        he had devised against the Jews.</p>
                    <p>4 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the
                        king,</p>
                    <p>5 And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the

                        reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to
                        destroy the Jews which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all the king&rsquo;s

                    <p>6 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see
                        the destruction of my kindred?</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the
                        Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows,
                        because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</p>
                    <p>8 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king&rsquo;s name, and
                        seal<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the king&rsquo;s ring: for the writing
                        which is written in the king&rsquo;s name, and sealed with the king&rsquo;s ring, may no man
                        reverse.</p>
                    <p>9 Then were the king&rsquo;s scribes called at that time in the third month,

                        execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was
                        turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)</p>
                    <p>2 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king
                        Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the
                        fear of them fell upon all people.</p>
                    <p>3 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the

                    <p>4 For Mordecai<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great in the king&rsquo;s house,
                        and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and
                        greater.</p>
                    <p>5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and
                        destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.</p>
                    <p>6 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.</p>
                    <p>7 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</p>
                    <p>8 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</p>

                    <p>10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the

                    <p>11 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the

                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
                        destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done
                        in the rest of the king&rsquo;s provinces? now
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy petition? and it shall be granted thee:
                        or what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy request further? and it shall be
                        done.</p>
                    <p>13 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Shushan to do to morrow also according
                        unto this day&rsquo;s decree, and let Haman&rsquo;s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</p>
                    <p>14 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged
                        Haman&rsquo;s ten sons.</p>
                    <p>15 For the Jews that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Shushan gathered
                        themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at
                        Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.</p>
                    <p>16 But the other Jews that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the king&rsquo;s
                        provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their
                        enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the
                        prey,</p>
                    <p>17 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they,
                        and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</p>
                    <p>18 But the Jews that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at Shushan assembled
                        together on the thirteenth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thereof, and on the

                    <p>19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day
                        of the month
                        Adar<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gladness

                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all the provinces of the king

                    <p>21 To stablish<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among them, that they should
                        keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</p>
                    <p>22 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto
                        them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of
                        feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</p>
                    <p>23 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;</p>
                    <p>24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised

                        to consume them, and to destroy them;</p>
                    <p>25 But when<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Esther</em><span>&nbsp;</span>came before the king, he
                        commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return
                        upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</p>
                    <p>26 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of
                        this letter,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which they
                        had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,</p>
                    <p>27 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined
                        themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to
                        their writing, and according to
                        their<span>&nbsp;</span><em>appointed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>time every year;</p>
                    <p>28 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>these
                        days<span>&nbsp;</span><em>should</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>remembered
                        and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>these days of Purim should not fail from
                        among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</p>
                    <p>29 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all
                        authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</p>
                    <p>30 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the
                        kingdom of Ahasuerus,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>words of peace and
                        truth,</p>
                    <p>31 To confirm these days of Purim in their times<span>&nbsp;</span><em>appointed</em>, according
                        as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for
                        themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.</p>
                    <p>32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</p>

                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>upon</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the isles of the sea.</p>
                    <p>2 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of
