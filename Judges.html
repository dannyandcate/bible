                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the Lord,
                        saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</p>
                    <p>2 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into
                        his hand.</p>
                    <p>3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against
                        the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</p>
                    <p>4 And Judah went up; and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites
                        into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</p>
                    <p>5 And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites
                        and the Perizzites.</p>
                    <p>6 But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and
                        his great toes.</p>
                    <p>7 And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut
                        off,
                        gathered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>meat</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under
                        my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there
                        he died.</p>
                    <p>8 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with
                        the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight
                        against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</p>
                    <p>10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron
                        before<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai,
                        and Ahiman, and Talmai.</p>
                    <p>11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir
                        before<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Kirjath-sepher:</p>
                    <p>12 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my
                        daughter to wife.</p>
                    <p>13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah
                        his daughter to wife.</p>
                    <p>14 And it came to pass, when she
                        came<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, that she moved him to ask of
                        her father a field: and she lighted from
                        off<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt
                        thou?</p>
                    <p>15 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also
                        springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of the Kenite, Moses&rsquo; father in
                        law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of
                        Judah, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lieth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the south of Arad; and they
                        went and dwelt among the people.</p>
                    <p>17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath,
                        and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</p>
                    <p>18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron
                        with the coast thereof.</p>
                    <p>19 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was with Judah; and he drave
                        out<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>inhabitants</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of
                        iron.</p>
                    <p>20 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
                    </p>
                    <p>21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the
                        Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against
                        Beth-el: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with them.</p>
                    <p>23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth-el. (Now the name of the city
                        before<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Luz.)</p>
                    <p>24 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray
                        thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</p>
                    <p>25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the
                        sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</p>
                    <p>26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof
                        Luz: which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the name thereof unto this day.</p>
                    <p>27<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Neither did Manasseh drive
                        out<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>inhabitants</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Beth-shean
                        and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the
                        inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
                        Canaanites would dwell in that land.</p>
                    <p>28 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did
                        not utterly drive them out.</p>
                    <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt
                        in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</p>
                    <p>30<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron,
                        nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</p>
                    <p>31<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor
                        the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of
                        Rehob:</p>
                    <p>32 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not
                        drive them out.</p>
                    <p>33<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of
                        Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the
                        inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became
                        tributaries unto them.</p>
                    <p>34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them
                        to come down to the valley:</p>
                    <p>35 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the
                        house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</p>
                    <p>36 And the coast of the Amorites<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the going
                        up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>AND an angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to
                        go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I
                        said, I will never break my covenant with you.</p>
                    <p>2 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their
                        altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</p>
                    <p>3 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall
                        be<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thorns</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in your
                        sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</p>
                    <p>4 And it came to pass, when the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake these words unto all
                        the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</p>
                    <p>5 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the Lord.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of
                        Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</p>
                    <p>7 And the people served the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>all the days of Joshua, and all the days of
                        the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord, that he did for
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord,
                        died,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an hundred and ten years old.</p>
                    <p>9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim,
                        on the north side of the hill Gaash.</p>
                    <p>10 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another
                        generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
                    </p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the
                        Lord, and served Baalim:</p>
                    <p>12 And they forsook the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of their fathers, which brought them out of
                        the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>round about them, and bowed themselves
                        unto them, and provoked the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to anger.</p>
                    <p>13 And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was hot
                        against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold
                        them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before
                        their enemies.</p>
                    <p>15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was against them for evil,
                        as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had said, and as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had sworn unto them:
                        and they were greatly distressed.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>raised up judges,
                        which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</p>
                    <p>17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods,
                        and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked
                        in, obeying the commandments of the Lord;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they
                        did not so.</p>
                    <p>18 And when the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>raised them up judges, then the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was
                        with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge:
                        for it repented the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>because of their groanings by reason of them that
                        oppressed them and vexed them.</p>
                    <p>19 And it came to pass, when the judge was
                        dead,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they returned, and
                        corrupted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>themselves</em><span>&nbsp;</span>more than their fathers, in
                        following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own
                        doings, nor from their stubborn way.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was hot
                        against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
                        commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</p>
                    <p>21 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left

                        many<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Israel</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as had
                        not known all the wars of Canaan;</p>
                    <p>2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least
                        such as before knew nothing thereof;</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Namely</em>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and
                        the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the
                        entering in of Hamath.</p>
                    <p>4 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments
                        of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
                        Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</p>
                    <p>6 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and
                        served their gods.</p>
                    <p>7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgat the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Therefore the anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was hot
                        against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and
                        the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</p>
                    <p>9 And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>raised up a
                        deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
                        them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s
                        younger brother.</p>
                    <p>10 And the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out
                        to war: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his
                        hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</p>
                    <p>11 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of
                        the Lord: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,
                        because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>13 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and
                        possessed the city of palm trees.</p>
                    <p>14 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p>
                    <p>15 But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>raised them up
                        a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of
                        Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</p>
                    <p>16 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under
                        his raiment upon his right thigh.</p>
                    <p>17 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and
                        Eglon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a very fat man.</p>
                    <p>18 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the
                        present.</p>
                    <p>19 But he himself turned again from the quarries
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret
                        errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
                    </p>
                    <p>20 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself
                        alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>seat.</p>
                    <p>21 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into
                        his belly:</p>
                    <p>22 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could
                        not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</p>
                    <p>23 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked
                        them.</p>
                    <p>24 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the
                        parlour<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>locked, they said, Surely he covereth
                        his feet in his summer chamber.</p>
                    <p>25 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour;
                        therefore they took a key, and opened<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and,
                        behold, their lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fallen down dead on the
                        earth.</p>
                    <p>26 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
                    </p>
                    <p>27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and
                        the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</p>
                    <p>28 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath delivered your
                        enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan
                        toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</p>
                    <p>29 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour;
                        and there escaped not a man.</p>
                    <p>30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
                    </p>
                    <p>31<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of
                        the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</p>

                    <p>AND the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead.</p>
                    <p>2 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in
                        Hazor; the captain of whose host<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Sisera, which

                    <p>6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him,
                        Hath not the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel commanded,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>,
                        Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
                        and of the children of Zebulun?</p>
                    <p>7 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin&rsquo;s army, with
                        his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.</p>
                    <p>8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with
                        me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will not go.</p>
                    <p>9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall
                        not be for thine honour; for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall sell Sisera into the hand of a
                        woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he
                        went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</p>
                    <p>11 Now Heber the

                        children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched
                        his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by
                        Kedesh.</p>

                    <p>13 And Sisera gathered together all his
                        chariots,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nine hundred chariots of iron, and
                        all the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, from Harosheth
                        of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</p>
                    <p>14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                        thousand men after him.</p>
                    <p>15 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>discomfited Sisera, and
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>chariots, and
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>host, with the edge of the sword before
                        Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>chariot,
                        and fled away on his feet.</p>
                    <p>16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and
                        all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the
                        sword;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there was not a man left.</p>
                    <p>17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>peace
                        between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn
                        in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she
                        covered him with a mantle.</p>
                    <p>19 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she
                        opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</p>
                    <p>20 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come
                        and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</p>
                    <p>21 Then Jael Heber&rsquo;s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went
                        softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
                        was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</p>
                    <p>22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and
                        I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into
                        her<span>&nbsp;</span><em>tent</em>, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the
                        nail<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his temples.</p>
                    <p>23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of
                        Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>

                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><em>They</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>delivered</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from
                        the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous
                        acts of the Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the righteous
                        acts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>toward</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>inhabitants</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of

                    <p>12 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity
                        captive, thou son of Abinoam.</p>
                    <p>13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>made me have dominion over the mighty.</p>
                    <p>14 Out of
                        Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a root
                        of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
                        governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.</p>
                    <p>15 And the princes of Issachar<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with Deborah;
                        even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of
                        Reuben<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great
                        thoughts of heart.</p>
                    <p>16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions
                        of
                        Reuben<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great
                        searchings of heart.</p>
                    <p>17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore,
                        and abode in his breaches.</p>
                    <p>18 Zebulun and Naphtali<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>jeoparded their lives unto the death in
                        the high places of the field.</p>
                    <p>19 The kings came<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fought, then fought the kings
                        of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.</p>
                    <p>20 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.</p>
                    <p>21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou
                        hast trodden down strength.</p>
                    <p>22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty
                        ones.</p>
                    <p>23 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because
                        they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>against the
                        mighty.</p>
                    <p>24 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above
                        women in the tent.</p>
                    <p>25 He asked water,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she
                        gave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly
                        dish.</p>
                    <p>26 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen&rsquo;s hammer; and with the
                        hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his
                        temples.</p>
                    <p>27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed,
                        there he fell down dead.</p>
                    <p>28 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his
                        chariot<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>long in coming? why tarry the wheels of
                        his chariots?</p>
                    <p>29 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,</p>
                    <p>30 Have they not sped? have they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span>&nbsp;</span>divided the
                        prey; to every man a damsel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>two; to Sisera a
                        prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework
                        on both sides,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>meet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for the necks
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>take</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        spoil?</p>
                    <p>31 So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord:
                        but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>them that love
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.
                        And the land had rest forty years.</p>

                    <p>AND the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.</p>
                    <p>2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against
                        Israel:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>because of the Midianites the children
                        of Israel made them the dens which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                        mountains, and caves, and strong holds.</p>
                    <p>3 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it was, when Israel had sown, that the
                        Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against
                        them;</p>
                    <p>4 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto
                        Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.</p>
                    <p>5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for
                        multitude;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>both they and their camels were
                        without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.</p>
                    <p>6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried
                        unto the Lord.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried
                        unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>because of the Midianites,</p>
                    <p>8 That the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto
                        them, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and
                        brought you forth out of the house of bondage;</p>
                    <p>9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed
                        you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;</p>
                    <p>10 And I said unto you, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but
                        ye have not obeyed my voice.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Ophrah,
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pertained</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his
                        son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to
                        hide<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the Midianites.</p>
                    <p>12 And the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>appeared unto him, and said unto him, The
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</p>
                    <p>13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be with us, why then is
                        all this befallen us? and where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all his miracles
                        which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>bring us up from Egypt?
                        but now the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the
                        Midianites.</p>
                    <p>14 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt
                        save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?</p>
                    <p>15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my
                        family<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>poor in Manasseh, and
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the least in my father&rsquo;s house.</p>
                    <p>16 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite
                        the Midianites as one man.</p>
                    <p>17 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou
                        talkest with me.</p>
                    <p>18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and
                        set<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before thee. And he said, I will tarry until
                        thou come again.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened
                        cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and
                        brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out unto him under the oak, and
                        presented<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>20 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and
                        lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon this rock, and pour out the broth.
                        And he did so.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>put forth
                        the end of the staff that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his hand, and
                        touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed
                        the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>departed out of
                        his sight.</p>
                    <p>22 And when Gideon perceived that he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an angel of
                        the Lord, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>face to face.</p>
                    <p>23 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him,
                        Peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
                    </p>
                    <p>24 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.</p>
                    <p>25<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him, Take thy father&rsquo;s young bullock, even the second
                        bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down
                        the grove that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by it:</p>
                    <p>26 And build an altar unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God upon the top of this rock, in the
                        ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the
                        grove which thou shalt cut down.</p>
                    <p>27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had said unto
                        him: and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it was, because he feared his
                        father&rsquo;s household, and the men of the city, that he could not
                        do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by day, that he
                        did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by night.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
                        behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by it, and the second bullock was offered
                        upon the
                        altar<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>built.
                    </p>
                    <p>29 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they
                        said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</p>
                    <p>30 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath
                        cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by it.</p>
                    <p>31 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he
                        that will plead for him, let him be put to death
                        whilst<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>morning:
                        if he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a god, let him plead for himself,
                        because<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hath cast down his altar.</p>
                    <p>32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he
                        hath thrown down his altar.</p>
                    <p>33<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the
                        children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of
                        Jezreel.</p>
                    <p>34 But the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and
                        Abi-ezer was gathered after him.</p>
                    <p>35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent
                        messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</p>
                    <p>36<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by
                        mine hand, as thou hast said,</p>
                    <p>37 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the

                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dry upon all
                        the earth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>beside</em>, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by
                        mine hand, as thou hast said.</p>
                    <p>38 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed
                        the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</p>
                    <p>39 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this
                        once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
                        fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</p>
                    <p>40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the
                        ground.</p>

                    <p>THEN Jerubbaal, who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Gideon, and all the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, rose up early, and pitched
                        beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by
                        the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</p>
                    <p>2 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Gideon, The people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>too many for me to give the Midianites
                        into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
                    </p>
                    <p>3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
                        Whosoever<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fearful and afraid, let him return and
                        depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and
                        there remained ten thousand.</p>
                    <p>4 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Gideon, The
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet<span>&nbsp;</span><em>too</em><span>&nbsp;</span>many;
                        bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall
                        be,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of whom I say unto thee, This shall go
                        with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go
                        with thee, the same shall not go.</p>
                    <p>5 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Gideon,
                        Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by
                        himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</p>
                    <p>6 And the number of them that lapped,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>putting</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their
                        hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon
                        their knees to drink water.</p>
                    <p>7 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I
                        save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>people go every man unto his place.</p>
                    <p>8 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent

                        every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was
                        beneath him in the valley.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
                        it into thine hand.</p>
                    <p>10 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</p>
                    <p>11 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down
                        unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the host.</p>
                    <p>12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley
                        like grasshoppers for multitude; and their
                        camels<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>without number, as the sand by the sea
                        side for multitude.</p>
                    <p>13 And when Gideon was come,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a man
                        that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of
                        barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell,
                        and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</p>
                    <p>14 And his fellow answered and said, This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing
                        else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of
                        Israel:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into his hand hath God delivered
                        Midian, and all the host.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, when Gideon
                        heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
                        into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath delivered into
                        your hand the host of Midian.</p>
                    <p>16 And he divided the three hundred men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>into</em><span>&nbsp;</span>three
                        companies, and he put a trumpet in every man&rsquo;s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within
                        the pitchers.</p>
                    <p>17 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of
                        the camp, it shall be<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em>, as I do, so shall ye do.</p>
                    <p>18 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on
                        every side of all the camp, and
                        say,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>The</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>sword</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                        Lord, and of Gideon.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Gideon, and the hundred men
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, came unto the outside of the
                        camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew
                        the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        their hands.</p>
                    <p>20 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their
                        left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to
                        blow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>withal:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and they cried, The sword of the Lord,
                        and of Gideon.</p>
                    <p>21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried,
                        and fled.</p>
                    <p>22 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>set every man&rsquo;s
                        sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in
                        Zererath,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the border of Abel-meholah, unto
                        Tabbath.</p>
                    <p>23 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out
                        of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
                        saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and
                        Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
                        Beth-barah and Jordan.</p>
                    <p>25 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock
                        Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of
                        Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</p>

                    <p>AND the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not,
                        when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.</p>
                    <p>2 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
                        you?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim
                        better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?</p>

                    <p>9 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down

                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now Zebah and

                    <p>12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian,
                        Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.</p>

                        taught the men of Succoth.</p>
                    <p>17 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of

                        slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em>,
                        so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they; each one resembled the children of a
                        king.</p>
                    <p>19 And he said, They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my

                        sword: for he feared, because he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet a youth.
                    </p>
                    <p>21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                        strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on their camels&rsquo; necks.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over
                        us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son&rsquo;s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the
                        hand of Midian.</p>
                    <p>23 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall rule over you.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of
                        you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings,
                        because they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ishmaelites.)</p>
                    <p>25 And they answered, We will willingly give<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>. And they spread a
                        garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</p>
                    <p>26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven
                        hundred<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shekels</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of gold; beside ornaments, and
                        collars, and purple raiment that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the kings
                        of Midian, and beside the chains that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>about
                        their camels&rsquo; necks.</p>
                    <p>27 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his
                        city,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a
                        whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so
                        that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the
                        days of Gideon.</p>
                    <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
                        house.</p>
                    <p>30 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.</p>
                    <p>31 And his concubine that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Shechem, she also
                        bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and
                        was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.</p>
                    <p>33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and
                        went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.</p>
                    <p>34 And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God, who had
                        delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:</p>
                    <p>35 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>namely</em>,
                        Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.</p>

                    <p>AND Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother&rsquo;s brethren, and communed
                        with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother&rsquo;s father, saying,</p>
                    <p>2 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
                        Whether<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better for you, either that all the sons
                        of
                        Jerubbaal,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>threescore

                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your bone and your flesh.</p>
                    <p>3 And his mother&rsquo;s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these
                        words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said,
                        He<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our brother.</p>
                    <p>4 And they gave him threescore and ten<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pieces</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                        silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which
                        followed him.</p>
                    <p>5 And he went unto his father&rsquo;s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of
                        Jerubbaal,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>threescore and ten persons, upon
                        one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>6 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made
                        Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Shechem.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when they
                        told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of
                        mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men
                        of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</p>
                    <p>8 The trees went
                        forth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>on</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>time</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</p>
                    <p>9 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God
                        and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</p>
                    <p>10 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come
                        thou,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>reign over us.</p>
                    <p>11 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to
                        be promoted over the trees?</p>
                    <p>12 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come
                        thou,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>reign over us.</p>
                    <p>13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be
                        promoted over the trees?</p>
                    <p>14 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come
                        thou,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>reign over us.</p>
                    <p>15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over
                        you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>come<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>put
                        your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of
                        Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>16 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and
                        if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the
                        deserving of his hands;</p>
                    <p>17 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand
                        of Midian:</p>
                    <p>18 And ye are risen up against my father&rsquo;s house this day, and have slain his sons,
                        threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant,
                        king over the men of Shechem, because he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your
                        brother;)</p>
                    <p>19 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this
                        day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also
                        rejoice in you:</p>
                    <p>20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of
                        Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour
                        Abimelech.</p>
                    <p>21 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his
                        brother.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,</p>
                    <p>23 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem
                        dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</p>
                    <p>24 That the cruelty<span>&nbsp;</span><em>done</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the threescore and ten
                        sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew
                        them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.</p>
                    <p>25 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed
                        all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</p>
                    <p>26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of
                        Shechem put their confidence in him.</p>
                    <p>27 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and
                        trode<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>grapes</em>, and made merry, and went
                        into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</p>
                    <p>28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Abimelech,
                        and who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Shechem, that we should serve
                        him?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why
                        should we serve him?</p>
                    <p>29 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to
                        Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.</p>
                    <p>30<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of
                        Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</p>
                    <p>31 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his
                        brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.</p>
                    <p>32 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
                    </p>
                    <p>33 And it shall be,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the morning, as soon as
                        the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he and the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him come out against thee, then mayest
                        thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.</p>
                    <p>34<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, by night, and they laid wait
                        against Shechem in four companies.</p>
                    <p>35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and
                        Abimelech rose up, and the people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                        him, from lying in wait.</p>
                    <p>36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of
                        the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men.
                    </p>
                    <p>37 And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and
                        another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</p>
                    <p>38 Then said Zebul unto him, Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>now thy mouth,
                        wherewith thou saidst, Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Abimelech, that we
                        should serve him?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not this the people that thou
                        hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</p>
                    <p>39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</p>
                    <p>40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were
                        overthrown<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wounded,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                        the entering of the gate.</p>
                    <p>41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should
                        not dwell in Shechem.</p>
                    <p>42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told
                        Abimelech.</p>
                    <p>43 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and
                        looked, and, behold, the people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>come forth out
                        of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</p>
                    <p>44 And Abimelech, and the company that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him,
                        rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the
                        two<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>companies ran upon
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>people</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        the fields, and slew them.</p>
                    <p>45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein, and beat down the city, and sowed
                        it with salt.</p>
                    <p>46<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem
                        heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em>, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
                    </p>
                    <p>47 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
                    </p>
                    <p>48 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him; and Abimelech took an axe in
                        his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and
                        laid<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on his shoulder, and said unto the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, What ye have seen me do, make
                        haste,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>do as
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>done</em>.</p>
                    <p>49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and
                        put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon
                        them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</p>
                    <p>50<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against
                        Thebez, and took it.</p>
                    <p>51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all
                        they of the city, and shut<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to them, and gat them
                        up to the top of the tower.</p>
                    <p>52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the
                        tower to burn it with fire.</p>
                    <p>53 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech&rsquo;s head, and all to brake
                        his skull.</p>
                    <p>54 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword,
                        and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and
                        he died.</p>
                    <p>55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his
                        place.</p>
                    <p>56<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he
                        did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:</p>
                    <p>57 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the
                        curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</p>

                    <p>11 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto the children of

                    <p>12 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me,
                        and I delivered you out of their hand.</p>
                    <p>13 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.</p>
                    <p>14 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your

                    <p>16 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord: and his soul was

                    <p>17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of

                    <p>NOW Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat
                        Jephthah.</p>
                    <p>2 And Gilead&rsquo;s wife bare him sons; and his wife&rsquo;s sons grew up, and they thrust out
                        Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father&rsquo;s house; for
                        thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son of a strange woman.</p>
                    <p>3 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered
                        vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the children
                        of Ammon made war against Israel.</p>
                    <p>5 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead
                        went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:</p>
                    <p>6 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of
                        Ammon.</p>
                    <p>7 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my
                        father&rsquo;s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?</p>
                    <p>8 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou
                        mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
                        inhabitants of Gilead.</p>
                    <p>9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the
                        children of Ammon, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
                    </p>
                    <p>10 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be witness between us,
                        if we do not so according to thy words.</p>
                    <p>11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over
                        them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in Mizpeh.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the
                        children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight
                        in my land?</p>
                    <p>13 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel
                        took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan:
                        now therefore restore those<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lands</em><span>&nbsp;</span>again peaceably.
                    </p>
                    <p>14 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:</p>
                    <p>15 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of
                        the children of Ammon:</p>
                    <p>16 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and
                        came to Kadesh;</p>
                    <p>17 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through
                        thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thereto</em>. And in like
                        manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would
                        not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>consent:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and Israel abode in Kadesh.</p>
                    <p>18 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of
                        Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but
                        came not within the border of Moab: for
                        Arnon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the border of Moab.</p>
                    <p>19 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel
                        said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</p>
                    <p>20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people
                        together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</p>
                    <p>21 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand
                        of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the
                        inhabitants of that country.</p>
                    <p>22 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the
                        wilderness even unto Jordan.</p>
                    <p>23 So now the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his
                        people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?</p>
                    <p>24 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</p>
                    <p>25 And now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou any thing better than Balak the
                        son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against
                        them,</p>
                    <p>26 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred
                        years? why therefore did ye not recover<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>within
                        that time?</p>
                    <p>27 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the
                        children of Ammon.</p>
                    <p>28 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he
                        sent him.</p>
                    <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came upon
                        Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from
                        Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over<span>&nbsp;</span><em>unto</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the children
                        of Ammon.</p>
                    <p>30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the
                        children of Ammon into mine hands,</p>
                    <p>31 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I
                        return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord&rsquo;s, and I will offer
                        it up for a burnt offering.</p>
                    <p>32<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to
                        fight against them; and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered them into his hands.</p>
                    <p>33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to
                        Minnith,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>twenty cities, and unto the plain of
                        the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the
                        children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>34<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold,
                        his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and
                        she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>only child;
                        beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</p>
                    <p>35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter!
                        thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my
                        mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.</p>
                    <p>36 And she said unto him, My father,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou hast
                        opened thy mouth unto the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy
                        mouth; forasmuch as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath taken vengeance for thee of thine
                        enemies,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the children of Ammon.</p>
                    <p>37 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I
                        may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</p>
                    <p>38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>two
                        months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</p>
                    <p>39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with
                        her<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his vow which he had vowed: and
                        she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</p>
                    <p>40<span>&nbsp;</span><em>That</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the daughters of Israel went yearly to
                        lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</p>

                    <p>2 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon;
                        and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.</p>
                    <p>3 And when I saw that ye delivered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not, I put my
                        life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this
                        day, to fight against me?</p>
                    <p>4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of
                        Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye
                        Gileadites<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fugitives of Ephraim among the
                        Ephraimites,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among the Manassites.</p>
                    <p>5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it
                        was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me
                        go over; that the men of Gilead said unto
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;</p>
                    <p>6 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to
                        pronounce<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right. Then they took him, and slew
                        him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two
                        thousand.</p>
                    <p>7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the cities of
                        Gilead.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.</p>
                    <p>9 And he had thirty sons, and thirty
                        daughters,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>whom</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he sent abroad, and took in thirty
                        daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.</p>
                    <p>10 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he
                        judged Israel ten years.</p>
                    <p>12 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite,
                        judged Israel.</p>
                    <p>14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he
                        judged Israel eight years.</p>
                    <p>15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of
                        Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.</p>

                    <p>AND the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord; and the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</p>
                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
                        Danites, whose name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Manoah; and his
                        wife<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>barren, and bare not.</p>
                    <p>3 And the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold
                        now, thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>barren, and bearest not: but thou
                        shalt conceive, and bear a son.</p>
                    <p>4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any
                        unclean<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing:</em></p>
                    <p>5 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no rasor shall come on his head: for the
                        child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
                        the hand of the Philistines.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of
                        God came unto me, and his countenance<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like the
                        countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>, neither told he me his name:</p>
                    <p>7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor
                        strong drink, neither eat any unclean<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for
                        the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then Manoah intreated the Lord, and said, O my Lord, let
                        the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the
                        child that shall be born.</p>
                    <p>9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she
                        sat in the field: but Manoah her husband<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        with her.</p>
                    <p>10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man
                        hath appeared unto me, that came unto me
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>day.</p>
                    <p>11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou the man that spakest unto the woman?
                        And he said, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em>.</p>
                    <p>12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall we do unto him?</p>
                    <p>13 And the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the
                        woman let her beware.</p>
                    <p>14 She may not eat of any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that cometh of the
                        vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any
                        unclean<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all that I commanded her let her
                        observe.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, I pray thee,
                        let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</p>
                    <p>16 And the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will
                        not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the Lord.
                        For Manoah knew not that he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an angel of the
                        Lord.</p>
                    <p>17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy name, that when thy sayings come to
                        pass we may do thee honour?</p>
                    <p>18 And the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name,
                        seeing it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>secret?</p>
                    <p>19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and
                        offered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon a rock unto the Lord:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>angel</em><span>&nbsp;</span>did
                        wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</p>
                    <p>20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel
                        of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked
                        on<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and fell on their faces to the ground.</p>
                    <p>21 But the angel of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then
                        Manoah knew that he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an angel of the Lord.</p>
                    <p>22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</p>
                    <p>23 But his wife said unto him, If the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>were pleased to kill us, he would
                        not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have
                        shewed us all these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, nor would as at this time have told
                        us<span>&nbsp;</span><em>such</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as these.
                    </p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and
                        the child grew, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>blessed him.</p>
                    <p>25 And the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>began to move him at times in the camp of Dan
                        between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p>

                    <p>AND Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
                    </p>
                    <p>2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of
                        the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.</p>
                    <p>3 Then his father and his mother said unto

                        woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a
                        wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she
                        pleaseth me well.</p>
                    <p>4 But his father and his mother knew not that
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the Lord, that he sought an occasion
                        against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</p>

                        Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</p>
                    <p>6 And the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he
                        would have rent a kid,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing in
                        his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</p>
                    <p>7 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned
                        aside to see the carcase of the lion: and,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</p>
                    <p>9 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he
                        gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase
                        of the lion.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made
                        there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</p>

                        find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out, then I will give you thirty sheets and
                        thirty change of garments:</p>
                    <p>13 But if ye cannot declare<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>me, then shall ye
                        give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy
                        riddle, that we may hear it.</p>
                    <p>14 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth
                        sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</p>
                    <p>15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson&rsquo;s wife, Entice thy
                        husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father&rsquo;s house
                        with fire: have ye called us to take that we
                        have?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>16 And Samson&rsquo;s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not:
                        thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not
                        told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have
                        not told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my father nor my mother, and shall I
                        tell<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thee?</p>
                    <p>17 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the
                        seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the
                        children of her people.</p>
                    <p>18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down,
                        What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sweeter than honey? and
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>stronger than a lion? And he said unto
                        them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came upon
                        him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave
                        change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went
                        up to his father&rsquo;s house.</p>
                    <p>20 But Samson&rsquo;s wife was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>given</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his
                        companion, whom he had used as his friend.</p>

                    <p>BUT it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his
                        wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not
                        suffer him to go in.</p>
                    <p>2 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her
                        to thy companion:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not her younger sister fairer
                        than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</p>
                    <p>3<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more
                        blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</p>
                    <p>4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail,
                        and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</p>
                    <p>5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he
                        let<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>go into the standing corn of the
                        Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the
                        vineyards<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>olives.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
                        answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to
                        his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet
                        will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</p>
                    <p>8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top
                        of the rock Etam.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and
                        spread themselves in Lehi.</p>
                    <p>10 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson
                        are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</p>
                    <p>11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest
                        thou not that the Philistines<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rulers over us?
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou
                        hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</p>
                    <p>12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand
                        of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
                        yourselves.</p>
                    <p>13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their
                        hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him
                        up from the rock.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when he came unto Lehi,
                        the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came mightily
                        upon him, and the cords that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon his arms
                        became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</p>
                    <p>15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand
                        men therewith.</p>
                    <p>16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I
                        slain a thousand men.</p>
                    <p>17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of
                        his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and
                        said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die
                        for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</p>
                    <p>19 But God clave an hollow place that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                        jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he
                        revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Lehi unto this day.</p>
                    <p>20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p>

                    <p>THEN went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.</p>
                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>told</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the

                        compassed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in, and laid wait for him all night
                        in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day,
                        we shall kill him.</p>
                    <p>3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the
                        city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and
                        put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon his shoulders, and carried them up to
                        the top of an hill that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before Hebron.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in
                        the valley of Sorek, whose name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Delilah.</p>
                    <p>5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see
                        wherein his great strength<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lieth</em>, and by
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>means</em><span>&nbsp;</span>we may prevail against him, that we may
                        bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven
                        hundred<span>&nbsp;</span><em>pieces</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of silver.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein
                        thy great strength<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lieth</em>, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
                        afflict thee.</p>
                    <p>7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then
                        shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
                    <p>8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried,
                        and she bound him with them.</p>
                    <p>9 Now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men
                        lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The
                        Philistines<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon thee, Samson. And he brake the
                        withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
                    </p>
                    <p>10 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I
                        pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</p>
                    <p>11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall
                        I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
                    <p>12 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The
                        Philistines<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon thee, Samson.
                        And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>liers in
                        wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</p>
                    <p>13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me
                        wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my
                        head with the web.</p>
                    <p>14 And she fastened<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the pin, and said unto
                        him, The Philistines<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon thee, Samson. And he
                        awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee,
                        when thine heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not with me? thou hast mocked
                        me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great
                        strength<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lieth</em>.</p>
                    <p>16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged
                        him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that his soul was vexed unto death;</p>
                    <p>17 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a rasor upon mine head;
                        for I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        Nazarite unto God from my mother&rsquo;s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me,
                        and I shall become weak, and be like any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em>man.</p>
                    <p>18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of
                        the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords
                        of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</p>
                    <p>19 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave
                        off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
                    </p>
                    <p>20 And she said, The Philistines<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon thee,
                        Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and
                        shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was departed from him.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
                        brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison
                        house.</p>
                    <p>22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</p>
                    <p>23 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto
                        Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered
                        into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</p>
                    <p>25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he
                        may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport:
                        and they set him between the pillars.</p>
                    <p>26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars
                        whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</p>
                    <p>27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the
                        Philistines<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the
                        roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</p>
                    <p>28 And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and
                        strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
                        Philistines for my two eyes.</p>
                    <p>29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was
                        borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</p>
                    <p>30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>all</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>might; and
                        the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein. So the dead which he slew at his
                        death were more than<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which he slew in his
                        life.</p>
                    <p>31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and
                        brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up, and buried him between Zorah and
                        Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</p>

                    <p>6 In those
                        days<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no king
                        in Israel,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>every man
                        did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right
                        in his own eyes.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the
                        family of Judah, who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a Levite, and he sojourned
                        there.</p>
                    <p>8 And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah to sojourn where he could
                        find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>place:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and he
                        came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</p>
                    <p>9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to
                        sojourn where I may find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>place</em>.</p>
                    <p>10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give
                        thee ten<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shekels</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of silver by the year, and a suit
                        of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</p>
                    <p>11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his
                        sons.</p>
                    <p>12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of
                        Micah.</p>
                    <p>13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will do me good, seeing I have a
                        Levite to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>priest.</p>

                        in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in;
                        for unto that
                        day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>all</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>inheritance
                        had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.</p>
                    <p>2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from
                        Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go,
                        search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
                    </p>
                    <p>3 When they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the house of Micah, they knew
                        the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who
                        brought thee hither? and what makest thou in
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>place?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and what hast thou here?</p>
                    <p>4 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his
                        priest.</p>
                    <p>5 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way
                        which we go shall be prosperous.</p>
                    <p>6 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the

                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
                        people that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein, how they dwelt careless,
                        after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no

                        shame in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thing; and
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>far from the Zidonians, and had no

                    <p>8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them,

                    <p>9 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold,
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very good:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye still? be not slothful to
                        go,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to enter to possess the land.</p>
                    <p>10 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it
                        into your hands; a place
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no want
                        of any thing that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the earth.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And there went from thence of the family of the Danites,
                        out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.</p>
                    <p>12 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place
                        Mahaneh-dan unto this day:
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>behind
                        Kirjath-jearim.</p>
                    <p>13 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then answered the five men that went to spy out the
                        country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an
                        ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have
                        to do.</p>
                    <p>15 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the
                        Levite,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto the house of Micah, and saluted
                        him.</p>
                    <p>16 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the children of Dan, stood by the
                        entering of the gate.</p>
                    <p>17 And the five men that went to spy out the land went
                        up,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>came in
                        thither,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>took the graven image, and the ephod,
                        and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with
                        the six hundred
                        men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>appointed
                        with weapons of war.</p>
                    <p>18 And these went into Micah&rsquo;s house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the
                        teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?</p>
                    <p>19 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be
                        to us a father and a
                        priest:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better for
                        thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a
                        family in Israel?</p>
                    <p>20 And the priest&rsquo;s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven
                        image, and went in the midst of the people.</p>
                    <p>21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before
                        them.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when they were a good way
                        from the house of Micah, the men that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                        houses near to Micah&rsquo;s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.</p>
                    <p>23 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah,
                        What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?</p>
                    <p>24 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away:
                        and what have I more? and
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye
                        say unto me, What aileth thee?</p>
                    <p>25 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows
                        run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.</p>
                    <p>26 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that
                        they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>too strong for him, he turned and went
                        back unto his house.</p>
                    <p>27 And they
                        took<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which
                        Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at
                        quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
                    </p>
                    <p>28 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        deliverer, because it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>far from Zidon, and they
                        had no business with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>man; and it was in the
                        valley that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lieth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by Beth-rehob. And they built a
                        city, and dwelt therein.</p>
                    <p>29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born
                        unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Laish
                        at the first.</p>
                    <p>30<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and
                        Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of
                        Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</p>
                    <p>31 And they set them up Micah&rsquo;s graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of
                        God was in Shiloh.</p>

                    <p>AND it came to pass in those days,
                        when<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no king
                        in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to
                        him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.</p>
                    <p>2 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father&rsquo;s
                        house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.</p>
                    <p>3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto

                        with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father&rsquo;s house: and when the
                        father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</p>
                    <p>4 And his father in law, the damsel&rsquo;s father, retained him; and he abode with him three
                        days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose
                        early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel&rsquo;s father said unto his son
                        in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.</p>
                    <p>6 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel&rsquo;s father
                        had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be
                        merry.</p>

                        the damsel&rsquo;s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
                        tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry;
                        and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.</p>
                    <p>10 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against
                        Jebus, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Jerusalem;

                    <p>13 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all
                        night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</p>
                    <p>14 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon
                        them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by
                        Gibeah, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belongeth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Benjamin.</p>
                    <p>15 And they turned aside thither, to go in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no man
                        that took them into his house to lodging.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of
                        the field at even, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also of mount Ephraim;
                        and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the
                        place<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Benjamites.</p>
                    <p>17 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the
                        old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?</p>
                    <p>18 And he said unto him, We<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>passing from
                        Beth-lehem-judah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from
                        thence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I: and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>now</em><span>&nbsp;</span>going to the
                        house of the Lord; and there<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no man that
                        receiveth me to house.</p>
                    <p>19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me,
                        and for thy handmaid, and for the young
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thy
                        servants:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        want of any thing.</p>
                    <p>20 And the old man said, Peace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee;
                        howsoever<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all thy
                        wants<span>&nbsp;</span><em>lie</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon me; only lodge not in the street.
                    </p>
                    <p>21 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their
                        feet, and did eat and drink.</p>
                    <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Now</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as they were making their
                        hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round
                        about,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>beat at the door, and spake to the
                        master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that
                        we may know him.</p>
                    <p>23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my
                        brethren,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nay</em>, I pray you, do
                        not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wickedly; seeing that this man is come into
                        mine house, do not this folly.</p>
                    <p>24 Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>here</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with
                        them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.</p>
                    <p>25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth
                        unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day
                        began to spring, they let her go.</p>
                    <p>26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man&rsquo;s
                        house where her lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em>, till it was light.</p>
                    <p>27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his
                        way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen
                        down<span>&nbsp;</span><em>at</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the door of the house, and her
                        hands<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the threshold.</p>
                    <p>28 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took
                        her<span>&nbsp;</span><em>up</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat
                        him unto his place.</p>
                    <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and
                        laid hold on his concubine, and divided
                        her,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>together</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with her bones, into twelve pieces,
                        and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</p>
                    <p>30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day
                        that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take
                        advice, and speak<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>minds</em>.</p>

                    <p>THEN all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man,
                        from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in Mizpeh.
                    </p>
                    <p>2 And the chief of all the people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of all the
                        tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred
                        thousand footmen that drew sword.</p>
                    <p>3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then
                        said the children of Israel, Tell<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em>, how was this wickedness?</p>
                    <p>4 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>belongeth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to
                        lodge.</p>
                    <p>5 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by
                        night,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thought to have slain me: and my
                        concubine have they forced, that she is dead.</p>
                    <p>6 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the
                        inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</p>
                    <p>7 Behold, ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all children of Israel; give here
                        your advice and counsel.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not

                        tent, neither will we
                        any<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>turn into his
                        house.</p>
                    <p>9 But now
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the thing
                        which we will do to
                        Gibeah;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>we</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>go</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>up</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by
                        lot against it;</p>
                    <p>10 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of
                        a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may
                        do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in
                        Israel.</p>
                    <p>11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe
                        of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this that
                        is done among you?</p>
                    <p>13 Now therefore deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the men, the children of
                        Belial, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Gibeah, that we may put them
                        to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the
                        voice of their brethren the children of Israel:</p>
                    <p>14 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go
                        out to battle against the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six
                        thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven
                        hundred chosen men.</p>
                    <p>16 Among all this
                        people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>seven
                        hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an
                        hair<span>&nbsp;</span><em>breadth</em>, and not miss.</p>
                    <p>17 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew
                        sword: all these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men of war.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the
                        house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle
                        against the children of Benjamin? And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said,
                        Judah<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>go</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>up</em><span>&nbsp;</span>first.
                    </p>
                    <p>19 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</p>
                    <p>20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put
                        themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</p>
                    <p>21 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the
                        Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.</p>
                    <p>22 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in
                        the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</p>
                    <p>23 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>until even, and
                        asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of
                        Benjamin my brother? And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, Go up against him.)</p>
                    <p>24 And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.</p>
                    <p>25 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the
                        ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went
                        up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the Lord, and fasted that day
                        until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.</p>
                    <p>27 And the children of Israel inquired of the Lord, (for the ark of the covenant of
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there in those days,</p>
                    <p>28 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying,
                        Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
                        cease? And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>29 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</p>
                    <p>30 And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put
                        themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</p>
                    <p>31 And the children of Benjamin went out against the
                        people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>were drawn away from the city; and they
                        began to smite of the people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>kill, as at other
                        times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
                        the field, about thirty men of Israel.</p>
                    <p>32 And the children of Benjamin said,
                        They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>smitten down before us, as at the first.
                        But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.</p>
                    <p>33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at
                        Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their
                        places,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of the meadows of Gibeah.</p>
                    <p>34 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was
                        sore: but they knew not that evil<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near them.
                    </p>
                    <p>35 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel
                        destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew
                        the sword.</p>
                    <p>36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to
                        the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
                    </p>
                    <p>37 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait
                        drew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>themselves</em><span>&nbsp;</span>along, and smote all the city with
                        the edge of the sword.</p>
                    <p>38 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they
                        should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</p>
                    <p>39 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to
                        smite<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>kill of the men of Israel about thirty
                        persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the first battle.</p>
                    <p>40 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites
                        looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</p>
                    <p>41 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that
                        evil was come upon them.</p>
                    <p>42 Therefore they
                        turned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>backs</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before
                        the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>came</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of the cities they destroyed in the
                        midst of them.</p>
                    <p>43<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Thus</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they inclosed the Benjamites round
                        about,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>chased
                        them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>trode them down with ease over against
                        Gibeah toward the sunrising.</p>
                    <p>44 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men of valour.</p>
                    <p>45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of
                        them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two
                        thousand men of them.</p>
                    <p>46 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the
                        sword; all these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men of valour.</p>
                    <p>47 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the
                        rock Rimmon four months.</p>
                    <p>48 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge
                        of the sword, as well the men of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>every</em><span>&nbsp;</span>city, as the
                        beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>NOW the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter
                        unto Benjamin to wife.</p>
                    <p>2 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up
                        their voices, and wept sore;</p>
                    <p>3 And said, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that
                        there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?</p>
                    <p>4 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and
                        offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</p>
                    <p>5 And the children of Israel said,
                        Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among all
                        the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the Lord? For they had made a
                        great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to Mizpeh, saying, He
                        shall surely be put to death.</p>
                    <p>6 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one
                        tribe cut off from Israel this day.</p>
                    <p>7 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And they said, What
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                        tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord? And, behold, there came none to the
                        camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.</p>
                    <p>9 For the people were numbered, and,
                        behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                        of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</p>
                    <p>10 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them,
                        saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women
                        and the children.</p>
                    <p>11 And this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall
                        utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</p>
                    <p>12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had
                        known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh,
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of Canaan.</p>
                    <p>13 And the whole congregation sent<span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to speak to
                        the children of Benjamin that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the rock
                        Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</p>
                    <p>14 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of
                        the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</p>
                    <p>15 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had made a
                        breach in the tribes of Israel.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do
                        for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</p>
                    <p>17 And they
                        said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>must</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                        inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
                    </p>
                    <p>18 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn,
                        saying, Cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that giveth a wife to
                        Benjamin.</p>
                    <p>19 Then they said,
                        Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a feast
                        of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in Shiloh
                        yearly<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>place</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on
                        the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to
                        Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</p>
                    <p>20 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the
                        vineyards;</p>
                    <p>21 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out
                        of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the
                        land of Benjamin.</p>
                    <p>22 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will
                        say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his
                        wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
                        time,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye should be guilty.</p>
                    <p>23 And the children of Benjamin did so, and
                        took<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wives, according to their number, of them
                        that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired
                        the cities, and dwelt in them.</p>
                    <p>24 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his
                        family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</p>
                    <p>25 In those
                        days<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no king
                        in Israel: every man
                        did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right
                        in his own eyes.</p>
