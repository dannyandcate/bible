                    <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham,
                        Ahaz,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw
                        concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span>be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</p>
                    <p>3 For, behold, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and
                        tread upon the high places of the earth.</p>
                    <p>4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the
                        fire,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the
                        waters<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>poured
                        down a steep place.</p>
                    <p>5 For the transgression of Jacob<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all this, and
                        for the sins of the house of Israel. What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        transgression of
                        Jacob?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        Samaria? and what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the high places of
                        Judah?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        Jerusalem?</p>
                    <p>6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the
                        field,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as plantings of a vineyard: and I will
                        pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</p>
                    <p>7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be
                        burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she
                        gathered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the hire of an harlot, and they
                        shall return to the hire of an harlot.</p>
                    <p>8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the
                        dragons, and mourning as the owls.</p>
                    <p>9 For her wound<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>incurable; for it is come unto
                        Judah; he is come unto the gate of my
                        people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Declare ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not at
                        Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</p>
                    <p>11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came
                        not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</p>
                    <p>12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast:
                        she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the beginning of the sin to the daughter of
                        Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</p>
                    <p>14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of
                        Achzib<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a lie to
                        the kings of Israel.</p>
                    <p>15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the
                        glory of Israel.</p>
                    <p>16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle;
                        for they are gone into captivity from thee.</p>

                    <p>WOE to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they
                        practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</p>
                    <p>2 And they covet fields, and take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by violence;
                        and houses, and take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away: so they oppress a
                        man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>
                    <p>3 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye
                        shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this
                        time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>evil.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In that day shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>take

                        hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he
                        removed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from me! turning away he hath divided
                        our fields.</p>
                    <p>5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the Lord.

                    <p>8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them
                        that pass by securely as men averse from war.</p>
                    <p>9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye
                        taken away my glory for ever.</p>
                    <p>10 Arise ye, and depart; for

                    <p>11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, I will
                        prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the
                        remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of
                        their fold: they shall make great noise by reason
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>multitude</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men.

                    <p>13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and
                        are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>on the

                    <p>AND I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of
                        Israel;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not for
                        you to know judgment?</p>
                    <p>2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh
                        from off their bones;</p>
                    <p>3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their
                        bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</p>
                    <p>4 Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from
                        them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>concerning the prophets that make

                        the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</p>
                    <p>7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their

                        judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</p>
                    <p>9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that
                        abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</p>
                    <p>10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
                    <p>11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets
                        thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and
                        say,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>among us?

                    <p>13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy
                        hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto
                        the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</p>

                    <p>2 Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord&rsquo;s controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for

                    <p>5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor
