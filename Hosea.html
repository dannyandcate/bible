                    <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</p>
                    <p>2 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your
                        days, or even in the days of your fathers?</p>
                    <p>3 Tell ye your children of it, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>your
                        children<span>&nbsp;</span><em>tell</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their children, and their children
                        another generation.</p>
                    <p>4 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left
                        hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
                    </p>
                    <p>5 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for
                        it is cut off from your mouth.</p>
                    <p>6 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose
                        teeth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the teeth of a lion, and he hath the
                        cheek teeth of a great lion.</p>
                    <p>7 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and
                        cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away; the branches thereof are made white.
                    </p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
                        youth.</p>
                    <p>9 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests,
                        the Lord&rsquo;s ministers, mourn.</p>
                    <p>10 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the
                        oil languisheth.</p>
                    <p>11 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley;
                        because the harvest of the field is perished.</p>
                    <p>12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also,
                        and the apple tree,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the trees of the
                        field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</p>
                    <p>13 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night
                        in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden
                        from the house of your God.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the
                        elders<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the inhabitants of the
                        land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>into</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the house of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, and cry unto the Lord,</p>
                    <p>15 Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at
                        hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</p>
                    <p>16 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yea</em>, joy and gladness from
                        the house of our God?</p>
                    <p>17 The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken
                        down; for the corn is withered.</p>
                    <p>18 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea,
                        the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</p>
                    <p>19 O Lord, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the
                        flame hath burned all the trees of the field.</p>
                    <p>20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the
                        fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p>

                    <p>BLOW ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of
                        the land tremble: for the day of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>cometh,
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nigh at hand;
                    </p>
                    <p>2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning
                        spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like,
                        neither shall be any more after it,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the

                    <p>3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the

                        behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</p>
                    <p>4 The appearance of them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the appearance of
                        horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</p>
                    <p>5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame
                        of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</p>
                    <p>6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.</p>
                    <p>7 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march
                        every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:</p>
                    <p>8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path:

                    <p>10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be

                        fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</p>
                    <p>13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God:

                        leave a blessing behind him;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a meat offering
                        and a drink offering unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God?</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:</p>

                        those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of
                        her closet.</p>
                    <p>17 Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them
                        say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should
                        rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people,
                        Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their God?</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then will the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be jealous for his land, and pity
                        his people.</p>
                    <p>19 Yea, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you
                        corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a
                        reproach among the heathen:</p>
                    <p>20 But I will remove far off from you the northern<span>&nbsp;</span><em>army</em>, and will
                        drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder
                        part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up,
                        because he hath done great things.</p>
                    <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the

                    <p>22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the

                    <p>23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God: for he
                        hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the
                        former rain, and the latter rain in the first<span>&nbsp;</span><em>month</em>.</p>
                    <p>24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.</p>
                    <p>25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the
                        caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.</p>
                    <p>26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never
                        be ashamed.</p>
                    <p>27 And ye shall know that I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst of

                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.</p>
                    <p>28<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass
                        afterward,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will pour out my spirit upon all
                        flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your
                        young men shall see visions:</p>
                    <p>29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.</p>
                    <p>30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of
                        smoke.</p>
                    <p>31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the
                        terrible day of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>come.</p>
                    <p>32 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whosoever shall
                        call on the name of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in
                        Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath said, and in the remnant whom
                        the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall call.</p>

                        recompence upon your own head:</p>
                    <p>8 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they
                        shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath
                        spoken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty
                        men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:</p>
                    <p>10 Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say,
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>strong.</p>
                    <p>11 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about:
                        thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord.</p>
                    <p>12 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to
                        judge all the heathen round about.</p>
                    <p>13 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the
                        fats overflow; for their wickedness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great.</p>
                    <p>14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near in the valley of decision.</p>
                    <p>15 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.</p>
                    <p>16 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem;
                        and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the hope of
                        his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.</p>
                    <p>17 So shall ye know that I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be
                        holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in that
                        day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the mountains shall drop down new wine,
                        and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a
                        fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim.</p>
                    <p>19 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the
                        violence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>against</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the children of Judah, because
                        they have shed innocent blood in their land.</p>
                    <p>20 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</p>
                    <p>21 For I will cleanse their blood<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have not
                        cleansed: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>dwelleth in Zion.<span>&nbsp;</span>HOSEA.</p>

                    <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of
                        Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah, kings of Judah,
                        and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</p>
                    <p>2 The beginning of the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>by Hosea. And the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of
                        whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
                        whoredom,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>departing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the Lord.</p>
                    <p>3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</p>
                    <p>4 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
                        little<span>&nbsp;</span><em>while</em>, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house
                        of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</p>
                    <p>5 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of
                        Jezreel.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter.
                        And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>God</em><span>&nbsp;</span>said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah:
                        for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</p>
                    <p>7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by

                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</p>
                    <p>9 Then said<span>&nbsp;</span><em>God</em>, Call his name Lo-ammi: for
                        ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not my people, and I will not be

                    <p>SAY ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah.</p>
                    <p>2 Plead with your mother, plead: for she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not my
                        wife, neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I her husband: let her therefore
                        put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</p>
                    <p>3 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a
                        wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</p>
                    <p>4 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for

                    <p>5 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she
                        said, I will go after my lovers, that give<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                        bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a
                        wall, that she shall not find her paths.</p>
                    <p>7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek
                        them, but shall not find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>then shall she say,
                        I will go and return to my first husband; for
                        then<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better with
                        me than now.</p>
                    <p>8 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and
                        gold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they prepared for Baal.</p>
                    <p>9 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season
                        thereof, and will recover my wool and my
                        flax<span>&nbsp;</span><em>given</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to cover her nakedness.</p>
                    <p>10 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her
                        out of mine hand.</p>
                    <p>11 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and
                        all her solemn feasts.</p>
                    <p>12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said,
                        These<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my rewards that my lovers have given me:
                        and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</p>
                    <p>13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she
                        decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me,
                        saith the Lord.</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
                        wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</p>
                    <p>15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and
                        she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the
                        land of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>16 And it shall be at that day, saith the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call
                        me no more Baali.</p>
                    <p>17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be
                        remembered by their name.</p>
                    <p>18 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the
                        fowls of heaven, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the creeping things of
                        the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will
                        make them to lie down safely.</p>
                    <p>19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness,
                        and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</p>
                    <p>20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord.</p>
                    <p>21 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the heavens,
                        and they shall hear the earth;</p>
                    <p>22 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</p>
                    <p>23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained
                        mercy; and I will say
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not

                        me:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>therefore</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will I change their glory into shame.
                    </p>
                    <p>8 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</p>
                    <p>9 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward
                        them their doings.</p>
                    <p>10 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase:
                        because they have left off to take heed to the Lord.</p>
                    <p>11 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto
                        them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath
                        caused<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to err, and they have gone a whoring
                        from under their God.</p>
                    <p>13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and
                        poplars and elms, because the shadow
                        thereof<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good: therefore your daughters shall
                        commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>
                    <p>14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit
                        adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore
                        the people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>doth not understand shall fall.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though thou, Israel, play the
                        harlot,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>let not Judah offend; and come not ye
                        unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth.</p>
                    <p>16 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will feed them
                        as a lamb in a large place.</p>
                    <p>17 Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>joined to idols: let him alone.</p>
                    <p>18 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her
                        rulers<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shame do love, Give ye.</p>
                    <p>19 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their
                        sacrifices.</p>

                        for judgment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>toward you, because ye have been a

                    <p>2 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though

                    <p>3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest
                        whoredom,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Israel is defiled.</p>
                    <p>4 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of

                    <p>6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord; but they shall not

                    <p>7 They have dealt treacherously against the Lord: for they have begotten strange children: now

                    <p>WHEN I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness

                    <p>3 They shall not dwell in the Lord&rsquo;s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they

                        and the great hatred.</p>
                    <p>8 The watchman of Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with my

                    <p>9 They have deeply corrupted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>themselves</em>, as in the days of

                    <p>WHEN Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a child, then I loved him, and

                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they called them, so they went from them: they
                        sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</p>
                    <p>3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
                    </p>
                    <p>4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off

                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be

                    <p>9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for

                    <p>WHEN Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he
                        died.</p>
                    <p>2 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their
                        silver,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>idols according to their own
                        understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice
                        kiss the calves.</p>
                    <p>3 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the
                        chaff<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is driven with the whirlwind out of the
                        floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</p>
                    <p>4 Yet I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God from
                        the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no saviour
                        beside me.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</p>
                    <p>6 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted;
                        therefore have they forgotten me.</p>
                    <p>7 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I
                        observe<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em></p>
                    <p>8 I will meet them as a
                        bear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bereaved<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>her</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>whelps</em>,
                        and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast
                        shall tear them.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in
                        me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine help.</p>
                    <p>10 I will be thy king:
                        where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
                    </p>
                    <p>11 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and
                        took<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away in my wrath.</p>
                    <p>12 The iniquity of Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bound up; his
                        sin<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hid.</p>
                    <p>13 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him:
                        he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an unwise son; for he should not stay long
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>place</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        breaking forth of children.</p>
                    <p>14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will
                        be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though he be fruitful
                        among<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brethren, an east wind shall come, the
                        wind of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall
                        become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant
                        vessels.</p>
                    <p>16 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the
                        sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.

                    <p>O ISRAEL, return unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
                    </p>
                    <p>2 Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and
                        receive<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>graciously: so will we render the calves
                        of our lips.</p>
                    <p>3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the
                        work of our
                        hands,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our gods:
                        for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger
                        is turned away from him.</p>
                    <p>5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as
                        Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
                    </p>
                    <p>7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall
                        revive<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent
                        thereof<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the
                        wine of Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>8 Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>say</em>, What have I to do any
                        more with idols? I have heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, and observed him:
                        I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit
                        found.</p>
                    <p>9 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wise, and he shall understand
                        these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prudent, and he shall know them? for
                        the ways of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>right, and the just shall
                        walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.</p>
