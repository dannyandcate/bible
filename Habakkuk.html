                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THE burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</p>
                    <p>2 O Lord, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not
                        hear!<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cry out unto
                        thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>violence, and thou wilt not save!</p>
                    <p>3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        behold grievance? for spoiling and
                        violence<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before me: and there
                        are<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>raise up strife and contention.</p>
                    <p>4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass
                        about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will work a work in your
                        days,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye will not believe, though it be
                        told<span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em>.</p>
                    <p>6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bitter and
                        hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the
                        dwellingplaces<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                        theirs.</p>
                    <p>7 They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>terrible and dreadful: their judgment and
                        their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</p>
                    <p>8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves:
                        and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall
                        fly as the eagle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hasteth to eat.</p>
                    <p>9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup
                        up<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the east wind, and they shall gather the
                        captivity as the sand.</p>
                    <p>10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall
                        deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</p>
                    <p>11 Then shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mind change, and he shall pass
                        over, and offend,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>imputing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this his power unto his
                        god.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>Art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou not from everlasting, O
                        Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O Lord, thou hast ordained them
                        for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of purer eyes
                        than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
                        treacherously,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holdest thy tongue when the
                        wicked
                        devoureth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>more
                        righteous than he?</p>
                    <p>14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
                        things,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        ruler over them?</p>
                    <p>15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in
                        their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</p>
                    <p>16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them
                        their portion<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fat, and their meat plenteous.</p>
                    <p>17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</p>

                    <p>I WILL stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say
                        unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</p>
                    <p>2 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered me, and said, Write the vision, and
                        make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>plain upon tables, that he may run that
                        readeth it.</p>
                    <p>3 For the vision<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet for an appointed time, but
                        at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely

                    <p>4 Behold, his soul<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is lifted up is not upright
                        in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yea also, because he transgresseth by

                        shalt be for booties unto them?</p>
                    <p>8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because
                        of men&rsquo;s blood, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the violence of the
                        land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may
                        set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</p>
                    <p>10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast
                        sinned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>against</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy soul.</p>

                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by
                        iniquity!</p>

                        people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</p>
                    <p>14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover
                        the sea.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle

                        their nakedness!</p>
                    <p>16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the
                        cup of the Lord&rsquo;s right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful
                        spewing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on thy

                    <p>17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
                        beasts,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>made them afraid, because of
                        men&rsquo;s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

                    <p>19 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold,

                    <p>A PRAYER of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</p>
                    <p>2 O Lord, I have heard thy speech,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>was afraid: O
                        Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath
                        remember mercy.</p>
                    <p>3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens,
                        and the earth was full of his praise.</p>
                    <p>4 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brightness was as the light; he had
                        horns<span>&nbsp;</span><em>coming</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out of his hand: and
                        there<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the hiding of his power.</p>
                    <p>5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>
                    <p>6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting
                        mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his
                        ways<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>everlasting.</p>
                    <p>7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>
                    <p>8 Was the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>displeased against the
                        rivers?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine anger against the
                        rivers?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy wrath against the sea, that thou
                        didst ride upon thine horses<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy chariots of
                        salvation?</p>
                    <p>9 Thy bow was made quite naked,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the
                        oaths of the
                        tribes,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>word.
                        Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p>
                    <p>10 The mountains saw thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they trembled: the
                        overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his
                        voice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lifted up his hands on high.</p>
                    <p>11 The sun<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>moon stood still in their habitation:
                        at the light of thine arrows they went,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the
                        shining of thy glittering spear.</p>
                    <p>12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p>
                    <p>13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy
                        people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for salvation with thine anointed;
                        thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the
                        neck. Selah.</p>
                    <p>14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a
                        whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as to
                        devour the poor secretly.</p>
                    <p>15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine
                        horses,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>through</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the heap of great waters.</p>
                    <p>16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my
                        bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto
                        the people, he will invade them with his troops.</p>
                    <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although the fig tree shall not blossom,
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fruit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock
                        shall be cut off from the fold,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
