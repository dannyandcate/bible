                    <p><span>25&nbsp;&nbsp;And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring

                    <p><span>26 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of
                            Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
                            Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara,

                    <p><span>27&nbsp;&nbsp;And they lodged round about the house of God, because the

                            oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
                            spices.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And Mattithiah,&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;of the Levites, who&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the
                            firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the
                            pans.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;of their brethren, of the sons of the
                            Kohathites,&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;over the shewbread, to
                            prepare&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;every sabbath.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And these&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the singers, chief of the fathers of the

                    <p><span>34 These chief fathers of the Levites&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;chief throughout their

                    <p><span>35&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife&rsquo;s

                    <p><span>38 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over
                            against their brethren.</span></p>
                    <p><span>39 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and
                            Abinadab, and Esh-baal.</span></p>
                    <p><span>40 And the son of Jonathan&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Merib-baal: and Merib-baal begat
                            Micah.</span></p>
                    <p><span>41 And the sons of Micah&nbsp;<em>were</em>, Pithon, and Melech, and

                    <p><span>42 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat

                    <p><span>43 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.</span></p>
                    <p><span>44 And Azel had six sons, whose names&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and

                    <p><span>NOW the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the
                            Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines
                            slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.</span></p>

                    <p><span>4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest
                            these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore
                            afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and
                            died.</span></p>

                            people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>THEN all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold,
                            we&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;thy bone and thy flesh.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou&nbsp;<em>wast</em>&nbsp;he that
                            leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord&nbsp;thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt
                            feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant
                            with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to
                            the word of the Lord&nbsp;by Samuel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Jebus;
                            where the Jebusites&nbsp;<em>were</em>, the inhabitants of the land.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless
                            David took the castle of Zion, which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the city of David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab
                            the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the
                            rest of the city.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 So David waxed greater and greater: for the Lord&nbsp;of
                            hosts&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;with him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10&nbsp;&nbsp;These also&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the chief of the mighty men whom David had,
                            who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;with all Israel,
                            to make him king, according to the word of the Lord&nbsp;concerning Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And this&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam,
                            an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred
                            slain&nbsp;<em>by</em>&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;at one time.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And after him&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite,
                            who&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;of the three mighties.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to
                            battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the
                            Philistines.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And they set themselves in the midst of&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;parcel, and delivered
                            it, and slew the Philistines; and the Lord&nbsp;saved&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;by a great
                            deliverance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15&nbsp;&nbsp;Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the
                            cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>16 And David&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;then in the hold, and the Philistines&rsquo;
                            garrison&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;then at Beth-lehem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of
                            Beth-lehem, that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;at the gate!</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well
                            of Beth-lehem, that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;by the gate, and took&nbsp;<em>it</em>, and
                            brought&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;to David: but David would not drink&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;it,
                            but poured it out to the Lord,</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of
                            these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for
                            with&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>jeopardy</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;their lives they brought
                            it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up
                            his spear against three hundred, he slew&nbsp;<em>them</em>, and had a name among the
                            three.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he
                            attained not to the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;three.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many
                            acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a
                            snowy day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of&nbsp;<em>great</em>&nbsp;stature, five cubits high;
                            and in the Egyptian&rsquo;s hand&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a spear like a weaver&rsquo;s beam;
                            and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian&rsquo;s
                            hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 These&nbsp;<em>things</em>&nbsp;did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among
                            the three mighties.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to
                            the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;three: and David set him over his guard.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the valiant men of the armies&nbsp;<em>were</em>, Asahel the brother of
                            Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,</span></p>

                    <p><span>2&nbsp;<em>They</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;armed with bows, and could use both the right

                    <p><span>15 These&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had

                    <p><span>16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come

                            if&nbsp;<em>ye</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;<em>come</em>&nbsp;to betray me to mine enemies,

                    <p><span>18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai,&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;chief of the

                            Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul
                            to&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>jeopardy</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;our heads.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael,

                            according to the word of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;six thousand
                            and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one
                            hundred.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And Jehoiada&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the leader of the Aaronites, and with
                            him&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;three thousand and seven hundred;</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father&rsquo;s house twenty and two
                            captains.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the
                            greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour,
                            famous throughout the house of their fathers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to
                            come and make David king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 And of the children of
                            Issachar,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;<em>men</em>&nbsp;that had
                            understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of
                            them&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;two hundred; and all their brethren&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;at
                            their commandment.</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war,
                            fifty thousand, which could keep rank:&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;not of

                    <p><span>34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and
                            seven thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half
                            tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and
                            twenty thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make
                            David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;of one
                            heart to make David king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had
                            prepared for them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>40 Moreover they that were nigh them,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;unto Issachar and Zebulun and
                            Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on
                            oxen,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine,
                            and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for&nbsp;<em>there</em><em>was</em>&nbsp;joy in
                            Israel.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND David consulted with the captains of thousands and
                            hundreds,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;with every leader.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel,
                            If&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>seem</em>&nbsp;good unto you,
                            and&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;of the Lord&nbsp;our God, let
                            us send abroad unto our brethren every where,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;left
                            in all the land of Israel, and with them&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;to the priests and
                            Levites&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in their
                            cities&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of
                            Saul.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes
                            of all the people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of
                            Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>, to
                            Kirjath-jearim, which&nbsp;<em>belonged</em>&nbsp;to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of
                            God the Lord, that dwelleth&nbsp;<em>between</em>&nbsp;the cherubims, whose name is
                            called&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and
                            Ahio drave the cart.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And David and all Israel played before God with all&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;might, and
                            with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and
                            with trumpets.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand
                            to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And the anger of the Lord&nbsp;was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he
                            put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And David was displeased, because the Lord&nbsp;had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore
                            that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of
                            God&nbsp;<em>home</em>&nbsp;to me?</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 So David brought not the ark&nbsp;<em>home</em>&nbsp;to himself to the city of David,
                            but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And
                            the Lord&nbsp;blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>NOW Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and
                            carpenters, to build him an house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And David perceived that the Lord&nbsp;had confirmed him king over Israel, for his
                            kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and
                            daughters.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Now these&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the names of&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;children which he
                            had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel,
                            all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David
                            heard&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>, and went out against them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou
                            deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord&nbsp;said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them
                            into thine hand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath
                            broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they
                            called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned
                            with fire.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn
                            away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry
                            trees,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth
                            before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines
                            from Gibeon even to Gazer.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord&nbsp;brought the fear of him
                            upon all nations.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND&nbsp;<em>David</em>&nbsp;made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for
                            the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the

                    <p><span>3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the

                    <p><span>7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and
                            twelve.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel,
                            Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And said unto them, Ye&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;the chief of the fathers of the Levites:
                            sanctify yourselves,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the
                            ark of the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel
                            unto&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>place</em>&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;I have prepared for
                            it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 For because ye&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;not at the first, the
                            Lord&nbsp;our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
                            order.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves
                            thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their

                            psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of
                            Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And with them their brethren of the second&nbsp;<em>degree</em>, Zechariah, Ben, and

                    <p><span>21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with
                            harps on the Sheminith to excel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;for song: he instructed
                            about the song, because he&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;skilful.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And Berechiah and Elkanah&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;doorkeepers for the ark.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah,
                            and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom
                            and Jehiah&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;doorkeepers for the ark.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25&nbsp;&nbsp;So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to
                            bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord&nbsp;out of the house of Obed-edom with
                            joy.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of
                            the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And David&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites
                            that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers:
                            David also&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;upon him an ephod of linen.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord&nbsp;with shouting, and
                            with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with
                            psalteries and harps.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass,&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;the ark of the covenant of the
                            Lord&nbsp;came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a
                            window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</span></p>

                    <p><span>SO they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched
                            for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings,
                            he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread,
                            and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>wine</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;And he appointed&nbsp;<em>certain</em>&nbsp;of the Levites to minister before
                            the ark of the Lord, and to record, and to thank and praise the Lord&nbsp;God of
                            Israel:</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
                            Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps;
                            but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the
                            covenant of God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on that day David delivered

                            Asaph and his brethren.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the

                    <p><span>9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Seek the Lord&nbsp;and his strength, seek his face continually.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his

                    <p><span>13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span></p>

                    <p><span>17 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to

                    <p><span>21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span></p>

                    <p><span>26 For all the gods of the people&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;idols: but the Lord&nbsp;made the

                    <p><span>27 Glory and honour&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in his presence; strength and

                    <p><span>28 Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord&nbsp;glory and
                            strength.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 Give unto the Lord&nbsp;the glory&nbsp;<em>due</em>&nbsp;unto his name: bring an
                            offering, and come before him: worship the Lord&nbsp;in the beauty of holiness.</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not
                            moved.</span></p>
                    <p><span>31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let&nbsp;<em>men</em>&nbsp;say

                    <p><span>32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all

                    <p><span>33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord, because he cometh
                            to judge the earth.</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 O give thanks unto the Lord; for&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good; for his
                            mercy&nbsp;<em>endureth</em>&nbsp;for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from
                            the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;glory in thy
                            praise.</span></p>
                    <p><span>36 Blessed&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the
                            people said, Amen, and praised the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>37&nbsp;&nbsp;So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord&nbsp;Asaph and
                            his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day&rsquo;s work
                            required:</span></p>
                    <p><span>38 And Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of
                            Jeduthun and Hosah&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;porters:</span></p>
                    <p><span>39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the
                            Lord&nbsp;in the high place that&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;at Gibeon,</span></p>
                    <p><span>40 To offer burnt offerings unto the Lord&nbsp;upon the altar of the burnt offering
                            continually morning and evening, and&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;according to all
                            that is written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded Israel;</span></p>
                    <p><span>41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by
                            name, to give thanks to the Lord, because his mercy&nbsp;<em>endureth</em>&nbsp;for
                            ever;</span></p>
                    <p><span>42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a
                            sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of
                            Jeduthun&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;porters.</span></p>
                    <p><span>43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>NOW it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo,
                            I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the
                            Lord&nbsp;<em>remaineth</em>&nbsp;under curtains.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in thine heart; for
                            God&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;with thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan,
                            saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me an house to
                            dwell in:</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day;
                            but have gone from tent to tent, and
                            from&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;tabernacle&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>another</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel,
                            whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of
                            cedars?</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord&nbsp;of
                            hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;from following the sheep,
                            that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine
                            enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men
                            that&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;in the earth.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall
                            dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness
                            waste them any more, as at the beginning,</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And since the time that I commanded judges&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;over
                            my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the
                            Lord&nbsp;will build thee an house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must
                            go&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed
                            after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from
                            him, as I took&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;that was before
                            thee:</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be
                            established for evermore.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto
                            David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;And David the king came and sat before the Lord, and said,
                            Who&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;I, O Lord&nbsp;God, and what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;mine house,
                            that thou hast brought me hitherto?</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And&nbsp;<em>yet</em>&nbsp;this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
                            hast&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;spoken of thy servant&rsquo;s house for a great while to come,
                            and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O
                            Lord&nbsp;God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 What can David&nbsp;<em>speak</em>&nbsp;more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for
                            thou knowest thy servant.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 O Lord, for thy servant&rsquo;s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done
                            all this greatness, in making known all&nbsp;<em>these</em>&nbsp;great things.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 O Lord,&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;none like thee,
                            neither&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;God beside thee,
                            according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And what one nation in the earth&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;like thy people Israel, whom God
                            went to redeem&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;his own people, to make thee a name of
                            greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast
                            redeemed out of Egypt?</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Lord,
                            becamest their God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 Therefore now, Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and
                            concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The
                            Lord&nbsp;of hosts&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the God of Israel,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;a God to
                            Israel: and&nbsp;<em>let</em>&nbsp;the house of David thy
                            servant&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;established before thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore
                            thy servant hath found&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;<em>heart</em>&nbsp;to pray
                            before thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And now, Lord, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be

                    <p><span>NOW after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and
                            took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David&rsquo;s
                            servants,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;brought gifts.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3&nbsp;&nbsp;And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish
                            his dominion by the river Euphrates.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty
                            thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot&nbsp;<em>horses</em>, but reserved of
                            them an hundred chariots.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the
                            Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 Then David put&nbsp;<em>garrisons</em>&nbsp;in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became
                            David&rsquo;s servants,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;brought gifts. Thus the Lord&nbsp;preserved
                            David whithersoever he went.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought
                            them to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass,
                            wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of
                            Hadarezer king of Zobah;</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate
                            him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with
                            Tou;) and&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;all manner of vessels of gold and silver
                            and brass.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Them also king David dedicated unto the Lord, with the silver and the gold
                            that he brought from all&nbsp;<em>these</em>&nbsp;nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and
                            from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen
                            thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13&nbsp;&nbsp;And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David&rsquo;s
                            servants. Thus the Lord&nbsp;preserved David whithersoever he went.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all
                            his people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;over the host; and Jehoshaphat the
                            son of Ahilud, recorder.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of

                    <p><span>17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;over the Cherethites and the

                    <p><span>NOW it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his
                            son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father
                            shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So
                            the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort
                            him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth
                            honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto
                            thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Wherefore Hanun took David&rsquo;s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments
                            in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Then there went&nbsp;<em>certain</em>, and told David how the men were served. And he
                            sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho
                            until your beards be grown, and&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;return.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to
                            David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them
                            chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people;
                            who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together
                            from their cities, and came to battle.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And when David heard&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>, he sent Joab, and all the host of
                            the mighty men.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the
                            city: and the kings that were come&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;by themselves in the
                            field.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of
                            all the choice of Israel, and put&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;in array against the
                            Syrians.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they
                            set&nbsp;<em>themselves</em>&nbsp;in array against the children of Ammon.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the
                            children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the
                            cities of our God: and let the
                            Lord&nbsp;do&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good in his
                            sight.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 So Joab and the people that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;with him drew nigh before the
                            Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before
                            Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they
                            sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;beyond the river:
                            and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer&nbsp;<em>went</em>&nbsp;before
                            them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon
                            them, and set&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>battle</em>&nbsp;in array against them. So when
                            David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven
                            thousand&nbsp;<em>men</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>fought</em>&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;chariots,
                            and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
                            they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the
                            children of Ammon any more.</span></p>

                    <p><span>AND it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go
                            out&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>battle</em>, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted
                            the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at
                            Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent
                            of gold, and&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;precious stones in it; and it was
                            set upon David&rsquo;s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the
                            city.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And he brought out the people that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in it, and
                            cut&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so
                            dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people
                            returned to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the
                            Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew
                            Sippai,&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;of the children of the giant: and they
                            were subdued.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the
                            brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;like a

                    <p><span>6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of&nbsp;<em>great</em>&nbsp;stature,
                            whose fingers and toes&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;four and twenty,
                            six&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;<em>hand</em>, and
                            six&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;<em>foot:</em>&nbsp;and he also was the son of
                            the giant.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David&rsquo;s brother slew

                    <p><span>AND Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba
                            even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know&nbsp;<em>it</em>.</span>

                    <p><span>3 And Joab answered, The Lord&nbsp;make his people an hundred times so many more as
                            they&nbsp;<em>be:</em>&nbsp;but, my lord the king,&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;they not all my

                    <p><span>4 Nevertheless the king&rsquo;s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and
                            went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And
                            all&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred
                            thousand men that drew sword: and Judah&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;four hundred threescore and
                            ten thousand men that drew sword.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king&rsquo;s word was abominable
                            to Joab.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now,
                            I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord&nbsp;spake unto Gad, David&rsquo;s seer, saying,</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee
                            three&nbsp;<em>things:</em>&nbsp;choose thee one of them, that I may
                            do&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;unto thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose thee</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Either three years&rsquo; famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while
                            that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh&nbsp;<em>thee;</em>&nbsp;or else three days the

                            Lord&nbsp;destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what
                            word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the
                            Lord; for very great&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand
                            of man.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Lord&nbsp;sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel
                            seventy thousand men.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the
                            Lord&nbsp;beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It
                            is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord&nbsp;stood by the threshingfloor
                            of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord&nbsp;stand between the earth
                            and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David
                            and the
                            elders&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>Israel</em>,&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;clothed
                            in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And David said unto God,&nbsp;<em>Is</em>&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;not
                            I&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned
                            and done evil indeed; but&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;these sheep, what have
                            they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O Lord&nbsp;my God, be on me, and on my
                            father&rsquo;s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the angel of the Lord&nbsp;commanded Gad to say to David, that David
                            should go up, and set up an altar unto the Lord&nbsp;in the threshingfloor of Ornan the
                            Jebusite.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the Lord.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now
                            Ornan was threshing wheat.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the
                            threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;face to the
                            ground.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;threshingfloor,
                            that I may build an altar therein unto the Lord: thou shalt grant it me for the full price:
                            that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 And Ornan said unto David, Take&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;to thee, and let my lord the king
                            do&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;good in his eyes: lo, I
                            give&nbsp;<em>thee</em>&nbsp;the oxen&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;for burnt offerings, and the
                            threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I
                            will not take&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;thine for the Lord, nor
                            offer burnt offerings without cost.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace
                            offerings, and called upon the Lord; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar
                            of burnt offering.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And the Lord&nbsp;commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath
                            thereof.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time when David saw that the Lord&nbsp;had answered him in the
                            threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the
                            burnt offering,&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>30 But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the
                            sword of the angel of the Lord.</span></p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>THEN David said, This&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the house of the Lord&nbsp;God, and
                            this&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;in the
                            land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for
                            the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood
                            to David.</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 And David said, Solomon my son&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;young and tender, and the
                            house&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;to be builded for the
                            Lord&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory
                            throughout all countries: I will&nbsp;<em>therefore</em>&nbsp;now make preparation for it.
                            So David prepared abundantly before his death.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the
                            Lord&nbsp;God of Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto
                            the name of the Lord&nbsp;my God:</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 But the word of the Lord&nbsp;came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and
                            hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed
                            much blood upon the earth in my sight.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest
                            from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and
                            quietness unto Israel in his days.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and
                            I&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;his father; and I will establish the throne of
                            his kingdom over Israel for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Now, my son, the Lord&nbsp;be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the
                            Lord&nbsp;thy God, as he hath said of thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Only the Lord&nbsp;give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning
                            Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord&nbsp;thy God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which
                            the Lord&nbsp;charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread
                            not, nor be dismayed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord&nbsp;an hundred
                            thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron
                            without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou
                            mayest add thereto.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Moreover&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;workmen with thee in abundance,
                            hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of
                            work.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the
                            iron,&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;no number. Arise&nbsp;<em>therefore</em>,
                            and be doing, and the Lord&nbsp;be with thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17&nbsp;&nbsp;David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his
                            son,&nbsp;<em>saying</em>,</span></p>
                    <p><span>18&nbsp;<em>Is</em>&nbsp;not the Lord&nbsp;your God with you? and hath
                            he&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of
                            the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his
                            people.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord&nbsp;your God; arise therefore, and
                            build ye the sanctuary of the Lord&nbsp;God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
                            and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p><span>SO when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>2&nbsp;&nbsp;And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the
                            Levites.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number
                            by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</span></p>
                    <p><span>4 Of which, twenty and four thousand&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;to set forward the work of the
                            house of the Lord; and six thousand&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;officers and judges:</span></p>
                    <p><span>5 Moreover four thousand&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;porters; and four thousand praised the
                            Lord&nbsp;with the instruments which I made,&nbsp;<em>said</em>&nbsp;<em>David</em>, to
                            praise&nbsp;<em>therewith</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,&nbsp;<em>namely</em>,
                            Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</span></p>
                    <p><span>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Gershonites&nbsp;<em>were</em>, Laadan, and Shimei.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 The sons of Laadan; the chief&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,
                            three.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
                            These&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 And the sons of Shimei&nbsp;<em>were</em>, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These
                            four&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;the sons of Shimei.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons;
                            therefore they were in one reckoning, according to&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;father&rsquo;s
                            house.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12&nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the
                            most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister
                            unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 Now&nbsp;<em>concerning</em>&nbsp;Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe
                            of Levi.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 The sons of Moses&nbsp;<em>were</em>, Gershom, and Eliezer.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the chief.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 And the sons of Eliezer&nbsp;<em>were</em>, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none
                            other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and
                            Jekameam the fourth.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21&nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and
                            Kish.</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish
                            took them.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24&nbsp;&nbsp;These&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;the sons of Levi after the house of their
                            fathers;&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of
                            names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the Lord, from the
                            age of twenty years and upward.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 For David said, The Lord&nbsp;God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they
                            may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:</span></p>
                    <p><span>26 And also unto the Levites; they shall no&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;carry the tabernacle,
                            nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 For by the last words of David the Levites&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;numbered from twenty
                            years old and above:</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 Because their office&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service
                            of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all
                            holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened
                            cakes, and

                    <p><span>2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and
                            Ithamar executed the priest&rsquo;s office.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons

                    <p><span>4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar;
                            and&nbsp;<em>thus</em>&nbsp;were they divided. Among the sons of

                    <p><span>5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary,
                            and governors&nbsp;<em>of</em>&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;<em>house</em>&nbsp;of God, were of

                            wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of

                    <p><span>29 And over the herds that fed in Sharon&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Shitrai the Sharonite: and

                    <p><span>30 Over the camels also&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the

                    <p><span>31 And over the flocks&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Jaziz the Hagerite. All
                            these&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;the rulers of the substance which&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;king
                            David&rsquo;s.</span></p>
                    <p><span>32 Also Jonathan David&rsquo;s uncle was a counseller, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel
                            the son of Hachmoni&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;with the king&rsquo;s sons:</span></p>
                    <p><span>33 And Ahithophel&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the king&rsquo;s counseller: and Hushai the
                            Archite&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;the king&rsquo;s companion:</span></p>
                    <p><span>34 And after Ahithophel&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar:

                            my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord&nbsp;over Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have
                            chosen him&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;my son, and I will be his father.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments
                            and my judgments, as at this day.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the Lord, and in the
                            audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord&nbsp;your God: that
                            ye may possess this good land, and leave&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;for an inheritance for your
                            children after you for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with
                            a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord&nbsp;searcheth all hearts, and
                            understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of
                            thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>10 Take heed now; for the Lord&nbsp;hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary:
                            be strong, and do&nbsp;<em>it</em>.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11&nbsp;&nbsp;Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the
                            houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the
                            inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the
                            Lord, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
                            treasuries of the dedicated things:</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service
                            of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the
                            Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14&nbsp;<em>He</em>&nbsp;<em>gave</em>&nbsp;of gold by weight
                            for&nbsp;<em>things</em>&nbsp;of gold, for all instruments of all manner of
                            service;&nbsp;<em>silver</em>&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;for all instruments of silver by
                            weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for
                            every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by
                            weight,&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;for the candlestick, and&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;for the
                            lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 And by weight&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>gave</em>&nbsp;gold for the tables of shewbread,
                            for every table; and&nbsp;<em>likewise</em>&nbsp;silver for the tables of silver:</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden
                            basons&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;<em>gave</em>&nbsp;<em>gold</em>&nbsp;by weight for every
                            bason; and&nbsp;<em>likewise</em>&nbsp;<em>silver</em>&nbsp;by weight for every bason of
                            silver:</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the
                            chariot of the cherubims, that spread out&nbsp;<em>their</em>&nbsp;<em>wings</em>, and
                            covered the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 All&nbsp;<em>this</em>,&nbsp;<em>said</em>&nbsp;<em>David</em>, the Lord&nbsp;made me
                            understand in writing by&nbsp;<em>his</em>&nbsp;hand upon me,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;all
                            the works of this pattern.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and
                            do&nbsp;<em>it:</em>&nbsp;fear not, nor be dismayed: for the
                            Lord&nbsp;God,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;my God,&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with
                            thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the
                            service of the house of the Lord.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the
                            Levites,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;<em>thee</em>&nbsp;for
                            all the service of the house of God:
                            and&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>shall</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;with thee for all manner
                            of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and
                            all the people&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;wholly at thy commandment.</span>

                    <p><span>FURTHERMORE David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God
                            hath chosen,&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>yet</em>&nbsp;young and tender, and the
                            work&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;great: for the palace&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;not for man, but for
                            the Lord&nbsp;God.</span></p>
                    <p><span>2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold
                            for&nbsp;<em>things</em>&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;<em>made</em>&nbsp;of gold,

                            stones in abundance.</span></p>
                    <p><span>3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own
                            proper good, of gold and silver,&nbsp;<em>which</em>&nbsp;I have given to the house of my
                            God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</span></p>
                    <p><span>4&nbsp;<em>Even</em>&nbsp;three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven

                    <p><span>5 The gold for&nbsp;<em>things</em>&nbsp;of gold, and the silver

                            work&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;<em>made</em>&nbsp;by the hands of artificers.
                            And who&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the
                            Lord?</span></p>
                    <p><span>6&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the
                            captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king&rsquo;s work, offered
                            willingly,</span></p>
                    <p><span>7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten
                            thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents,
                            and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</span></p>
                    <p><span>8 And they with whom&nbsp;<em>precious</em>&nbsp;stones were found
                            gave&nbsp;<em>them</em>&nbsp;to the treasure of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jehiel
                            the Gershonite.</span></p>
                    <p><span>9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart
                            they offered willingly to the Lord: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span>10&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore David blessed the Lord&nbsp;before all the congregation: and David
                            said, Blessed&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;thou, Lord&nbsp;God of Israel our father, for ever and
                            ever.</span></p>
                    <p><span>11 Thine, O Lord,&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and
                            the victory, and the majesty: for all&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;in the heaven
                            and in the earth&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;<em>thine;</em>&nbsp;thine&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the
                            kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.</span></p>
                    <p><span>12 Both riches and honour&nbsp;<em>come</em>&nbsp;of thee, and thou reignest over all; and
                            in thine hand&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;power and might; and in thine
                            hand&nbsp;<em>it</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;to make great, and to give strength unto
                            all.</span></p>
                    <p><span>13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</span></p>
                    <p><span>14 But who&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;I, and what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;my people, that we
                            should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all
                            things&nbsp;<em>come</em>&nbsp;of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>15 For we&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strangers before thee, and sojourners,
                            as&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;all our fathers: our days on the earth&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;as
                            a shadow, and&nbsp;<em>there</em>&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;none abiding.</span></p>
                    <p><span>16 O Lord&nbsp;our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for
                            thine holy name&nbsp;<em>cometh</em>&nbsp;of thine hand, and&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;all thine
                            own.</span></p>
                    <p><span>17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As
                            for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now
                            have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto
                            thee.</span></p>
                    <p><span>18 O Lord&nbsp;God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the
                            imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto
                            thee:</span></p>
                    <p><span>19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies,
                            and thy statutes, and to do all&nbsp;<em>these</em>&nbsp;<em>things</em>, and to build the
                            palace,&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;the which I have made provision.</span></p>
                    <p><span>20&nbsp;&nbsp;And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the Lord&nbsp;your God. And
                            all the congregation blessed the Lord&nbsp;God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads,
                            and worshipped the Lord, and the king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord,
                            on the morrow after that day,&nbsp;<em>even</em>&nbsp;a thousand bullocks, a thousand
                            rams,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in
                            abundance for all Israel:</span></p>
                    <p><span>22 And did eat and drink before the Lord&nbsp;on that day with great gladness. And they
                            made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed&nbsp;<em>him</em>&nbsp;unto
                            the Lord&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;the chief governor, and
                            Zadok&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;priest.</span></p>
                    <p><span>23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord&nbsp;as king instead of David his father, and
                            prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</span></p>
                    <p><span>24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David,
                            submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</span></p>
                    <p><span>25 And the Lord&nbsp;magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed
                            upon him&nbsp;<em>such</em>&nbsp;royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in
                            Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>26&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</span></p>
                    <p><span>27 And the time that he reigned over Israel&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;forty years; seven years
                            reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three&nbsp;<em>years</em>&nbsp;reigned he in
                            Jerusalem.</span></p>
                    <p><span>28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son
                            reigned in his stead.</span></p>
                    <p><span>29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold,
                            they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
                            Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</span></p>
                    <p><span>30 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and
                            over all the kingdoms of the countries.</span></p>
