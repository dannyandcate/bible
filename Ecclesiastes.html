                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THE words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity.</p>
                    <p>3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;</span><em>One</em><span>&nbsp;</span>generation passeth away,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>another</em><span>&nbsp;</span>generation cometh: but the earth
                        abideth for ever.</p>
                    <p>5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</p>
                    <p>6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about
                        continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</p>
                    <p>7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the
                        sea<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not full; unto the place from whence the
                        rivers come, thither they return again.</p>
                    <p>8 All things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>full of labour; man cannot
                        utter<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor
                        the ear filled with hearing.</p>
                    <p>9 The thing that hath been,
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which shall
                        be; and that which is done<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that which shall be
                        done: and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        new<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under the sun.</p>
                    <p>10 Is there<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thing whereof it may be said, See,
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>new? it hath been already of old time,
                        which was before us.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        remembrance of former<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>neither shall there
                        be<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>remembrance
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that are to come
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>those</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that shall come after.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that are done under heaven: this sore
                        travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</p>
                    <p>14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold,
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><em>That</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>crooked
                        cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
                    <p>16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more
                        wisdom than all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that have been before me in
                        Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
                    <p>17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also
                        is vexation of spirit.</p>
                    <p>18 For in much wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>much grief: and he that
                        increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>I SAID in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and,
                        behold, this also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity.</p>
                    <p>2 I said of
                        laughter,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mad: and
                        of mirth, What doeth it?</p>
                    <p>3 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to
                        lay hold on folly, till I might see what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</p>
                    <p>4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</p>
                    <p>5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>kind</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fruits:</p>
                    <p>6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</p>
                    <p>7 I got<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em><span>&nbsp;</span>servants and maidens, and had servants
                        born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in
                        Jerusalem before me:</p>
                    <p>8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I
                        gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of
                        men,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
                    </p>
                    <p>9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom
                        remained with me.</p>
                    <p>10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy;
                        for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</p>
                    <p>11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had
                        laboured to do: and, behold, all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity and
                        vexation of spirit,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no profit
                        under the sun.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
                        what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>can</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that cometh after the
                        king?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that which hath been already done.</p>
                    <p>13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</p>
                    <p>14 The wise man&rsquo;s eyes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in his head; but
                        the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.
                    </p>
                    <p>15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was
                        I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity.</p>
                    <p>16 For<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which
                        now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the days to come shall all be forgotten.
                        And how dieth the wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the fool.</p>
                    <p>17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the
                        sun<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>grievous unto me: for
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I
                        should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</p>
                    <p>19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>or
                        a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have
                        shewed myself wise under the sun. This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also
                        vanity.</p>
                    <p>20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the
                        sun.</p>
                    <p>21 For there is a man whose labour<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in wisdom, and
                        in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his portion. This
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity and a great evil.</p>
                    <p>22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath
                        laboured under the sun?</p>
                    <p>23 For all his days<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sorrows, and his travail
                        grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</p>
                    <p>24<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing
                        better for a man,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>than</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that he should eat and
                        drink, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he should make his soul enjoy good
                        in his labour. This also I saw, that it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from
                        the hand of God.</p>
                    <p>25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hereunto</em>, more than I?</p>
                    <p>26 For<span>&nbsp;</span><em>God</em><span>&nbsp;</span>giveth to a man
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge,
                        and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give
                        to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good
                        before God. This also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity and vexation of
                        spirit.</p>

                    <p>15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that
                        which is past.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of
                        judgment,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wickedness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there;
                        and the place of
                        righteousness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>iniquity<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a time
                        there for every purpose and for every work.</p>
                    <p>18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them,
                        and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</p>
                    <p>19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as
                        the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
                        preeminence above a beast: for all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity.</p>
                    <p>20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</p>
                    <p>21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth
                        downward to the earth?</p>
                    <p>22 Wherefore I perceive
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>nothing
                        better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his portion: for who shall bring him to see
                        what shall be after him?</p>

                    <p>SO I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the
                        tears
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>such</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>oppressed,
                        and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
                        oppressors<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>power;
                        but they had no comforter.</p>
                    <p>2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
                    </p>
                    <p>3 Yea, better<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>than
                        both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a
                        man is envied of his neighbour. This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also vanity
                        and vexation of spirit.</p>
                    <p>5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>
                    <p>6 Better<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                        handful<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>quietness, than both the hands
                        full<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span>travail and vexation of spirit.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>
                    <p>8 There is one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>alone</em>,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a
                        second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother:
                        yet<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no end of
                        all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches;
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saith</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em>, For whom do I labour,
                        and bereave my soul of good? This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also vanity,
                        yea, it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>a sore travail.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than one;
                        because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>
                    <p>10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
                        him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>alone when
                        he falleth;
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not another
                        to help him up.</p>
                    <p>11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be
                        warm<span>&nbsp;</span><em>alone?</em></p>
                    <p>12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly
                        broken.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Better<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a poor and a
                        wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>
                    <p>14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>born
                        in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>
                    <p>15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand
                        up in his stead.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no end of all
                        the people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of all that have been before them:
                        they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

                    <p>KEEP thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the
                        sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</p>
                    <p>2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to
                        utter<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thing before God: for
                        God<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore
                        let thy words be few.</p>
                    <p>3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool&rsquo;s
                        voice<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>known</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by
                        multitude of words.</p>
                    <p>4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it;
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no pleasure
                        in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</p>
                    <p>5 Better<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that thou
                        shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</p>
                    <p>6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an error: wherefore should God be angry at
                        thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</p>
                    <p>7 For in the multitude of dreams and many
                        words<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>divers</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanities:
                        but fear thou God.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of
                        judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter:
                        for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>higher
                        than the highest regardeth;
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>higher than
                        they.</p>
                    <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the
                        king<span>&nbsp;</span><em>himself</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is served by the field.</p>
                    <p>10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with
                        increase: this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also vanity.</p>
                    <p>11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what
                        good<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the

                        eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</p>
                    <p>13 There is a sore evil<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have seen under the
                        sun,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>namely</em>, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</p>
                    <p>14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son,

                    <p>15 As he came forth of his mother&rsquo;s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall
                        take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</p>
                    <p>16 And this also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a sore
                        evil,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all points as he came, so shall he
                        go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?</p>
                    <p>17 All his days also he eateth in darkness,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span>much sorrow
                        and wrath with his sickness.</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which I have

                    <p>19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat
                        thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour;

                    <p>THERE is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>common among men:</p>
                    <p>2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his
                        soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth

                    <p>A GOOD name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than precious ointment; and
                        the day of death than the day of one&rsquo;s birth.</p>
                    <p>2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better to
                        go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for
                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the end of all men; and the living will
                        lay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to his heart.</p>
                    <p>3 Sorrow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than laughter: for by the sadness
                        of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
                    <p>4 The heart of the wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the house of mourning;
                        but the heart of fools<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the house of mirth.
                    </p>
                    <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better to hear
                        the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>
                    <p>6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot,
                        so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the laughter of the fool: this
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity.</p>
                    <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>8 Better<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the end of a thing than the beginning
                        thereof:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the patient in
                        spirit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than the proud in spirit.</p>
                    <p>9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p>
                    <p>10 Say not thou, What
                        is<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>cause</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that the
                        former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good with an
                        inheritance:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>profit
                        to them that see the sun.</p>
                    <p>12 For wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        defence,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>money<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        defence: but the excellency of
                        knowledge<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wisdom
                        giveth life to them that have it.</p>
                    <p>13 Consider the work of God: for who can
                        make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>straight, which he hath made crooked?</p>
                    <p>14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set
                        the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</p>
                    <p>15 All<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>have I seen in the days of my vanity:
                        there is a just<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that perisheth in his
                        righteousness, and there is a wicked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        prolongeth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>life</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        his wickedness.</p>
                    <p>16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy
                        thyself?</p>
                    <p>17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good that thou
                        shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth
                        God shall come forth of them all.</p>
                    <p>19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten
                        mighty<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which are in the city.</p>
                    <p>20 For<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not a
                        just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>
                    <p>21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</p>
                    <p>22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>
                    <p>23<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>far from me.</p>
                    <p>24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</p>
                    <p>25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the
                        reason<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, and to know the
                        wickedness of folly, even of
                        foolishness<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>madness:</p>
                    <p>26 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose
                        heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>snares and
                        nets,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>her
                        hands<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape
                        from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</p>
                    <p>27 Behold, this have I found, saith the
                        preacher,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>counting</em><span>&nbsp;</span>one by one, to find out the
                        account:</p>
                    <p>28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman
                        among all those have I not found.</p>
                    <p>29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many
                        inventions.</p>

                    <p>WHO<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as the
                        wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and who knoweth the interpretation of a
                        thing? a man&rsquo;s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be
                        changed.</p>
                    <p>2 I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>counsel</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to keep
                        the king&rsquo;s commandment, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in regard of
                        the oath of God.</p>
                    <p>3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever
                        pleaseth him.</p>
                    <p>4 Where the word of a
                        king<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>power:
                        and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
                    <p>5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man&rsquo;s heart discerneth
                        both time and judgment.</p>
                    <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
                        misery of man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great upon him.</p>
                    <p>7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no man that
                        hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit;
                        neither<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>power in
                        the day of death:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        discharge in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>war; neither shall wickedness
                        deliver those that are given to it.</p>
                    <p>9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the
                        sun:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a time
                        wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
                    <p>10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they
                        were forgotten in the city where they had so done:
                        this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also vanity.</p>
                    <p>11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the
                        sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
                    <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and
                        his<span>&nbsp;</span><em>days</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be prolonged, yet surely I know that it
                        shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>
                    <p>13 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
                        prolong<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>days,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                        a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
                    <p>14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
                        just<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked;
                        again, there be wicked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, to whom it happeneth according to the
                        work of the righteous: I said that this
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity.</p>
                    <p>15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to
                        drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which
                        God giveth him under the sun.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that
                        is done upon the earth: (for
                        also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>neither
                        day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
                    <p>17 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the
                        sun: because though a man labour to seek<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out,
                        yet he shall not find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yea further; though a

                        that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy portion
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>life, and in thy labour which thou takest
                        under the sun.</p>
                    <p>10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thy
                        might; for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                        work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the
                        race<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not to the swift, nor the battle to the
                        strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to
                        men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
                    <p>12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the
                        birds that are caught in the snare; so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the sons
                        of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and
                        it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>seemed</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great unto me:</p>
                    <p>14<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a little
                        city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built
                        great bulwarks against it:</p>
                    <p>15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man
                        remembered that same poor man.</p>
                    <p>16 Then said I, Wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than strength:
                        nevertheless the poor man&rsquo;s
                        wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>despised, and his words are not heard.
                    </p>
                    <p>17 The words of
                        wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>heard in
                        quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</p>
                    <p>18 Wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>better than weapons of war: but one
                        sinner destroyeth much good.</p>

                    <p>DEAD flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking
                        savour:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>doth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a little
                        folly him that is in reputation for
                        wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>honour.</p>
                    <p>2 A wise man&rsquo;s heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at his right hand; but
                        a fool&rsquo;s heart at his left.</p>
                    <p>3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom
                        faileth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, and he saith to every
                        one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                        fool.</p>
                    <p>4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth
                        great offences.</p>
                    <p>5 There is an evil<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have seen under the sun,
                        as an error<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>proceedeth from the ruler:</p>
                    <p>6 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</p>
                    <p>7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>
                    <p>8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite
                        him.</p>
                    <p>9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt
                        therewith;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he that cleaveth wood shall be
                        endangered thereby.</p>
                    <p>10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but
                        wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>profitable to direct.</p>
                    <p>11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>
                    <p>12 The words of a wise man&rsquo;s
                        mouth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gracious; but the lips of a fool will
                        swallow up himself.</p>
                    <p>13 The beginning of the words of his
                        mouth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>foolishness: and the end of his
                        talk<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mischievous madness.</p>
                    <p>14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him,
                        who can tell him?</p>
                    <p>15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the
                        city.</p>
                    <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe to thee, O land, when thy
                        king<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a child, and thy princes eat in the
                        morning!</p>
                    <p>17 Blessed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou, O land, when thy
                        king<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in
                        due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
                    <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of
                        the hands the house droppeth through.</p>
                    <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
                        answereth all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>.</p>
                    <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in
                        thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall
                        tell the matter.</p>

                    <p>CAST thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</p>
                    <p>2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the

                    <p>REMEMBER now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years
                        draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;</p>
                    <p>2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return
                        after the rain:</p>
                    <p>3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow
                        themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows

                        shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:</p>
                    <p>6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at
                        the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</p>
                    <p>7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who
                        gave it.</p>
                    <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher;
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity.</p>
                    <p>9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave
                        good heed, and sought out,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>set in order many
                        proverbs.</p>
                    <p>10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words:
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>written<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upright,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>words
                        of truth.</p>
                    <p>11 The words of the wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as goads, and as nails
                        fastened<span>&nbsp;</span><em>by</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the masters of
                        assemblies,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are given from one shepherd.</p>
                    <p>12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
                        books<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no end;
                        and much study<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a weariness of the flesh.</p>
                    <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his
                        commandments: for this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                        whole<span>&nbsp;</span><em>duty</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of man.</p>
                    <p>14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
                        whether<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good, or
