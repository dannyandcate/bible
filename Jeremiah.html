                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>THE words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
                        </p>
                        <p>2 To whom the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon
                            king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</p>
                        <p>3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the
                            eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of
                            Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</p>
                        <p>4 Then the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto me, saying,</p>
                        <p>5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb
                            I sanctified thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I ordained thee a
                            prophet unto the nations.</p>
                        <p>6 Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a child.</p>
                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Say not,
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a child: for thou shalt go to all that I
                            shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</p>
                        <p>8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with
                            thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>9 Then the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</p>
                        <p>10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to
                            pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto me,
                            saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</p>
                        <p>12 Then said the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my
                            word to perform it.</p>
                        <p>13 And the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto me the second time, saying, What
                            seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face
                            thereof<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>toward the north.</p>
                        <p>14 Then the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth
                            upon all the inhabitants of the land.</p>
                        <p>15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord; and
                            they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of
                            Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of
                            Judah.</p>
                        <p>16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have
                            forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them
                            all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
                        </p>
                        <p>18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen
                            walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof,
                            against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.</p>
                        <p>19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver
                            thee.</p>

                        <p>MOREOVER the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came to me, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; I remember thee, the
                            kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the
                            wilderness, in a
                            land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                            sown.</p>
                        <p>3 Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holiness unto the
                            Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the firstfruits of his increase: all
                            that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>4 Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of
                            Israel:</p>
                        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me,
                            that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</p>
                        <p>6 Neither said they, Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the
                            wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the
                            shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</p>
                        <p>7 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness
                            thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</p>
                        <p>8 The priests said not, Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord? and
                            they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the
                            prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked
                            after<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>do
                            not profit.</p>
                        <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord, and with your
                            children&rsquo;s children will I plead.</p>
                        <p>10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently,
                            and see if there be such a thing.</p>
                        <p>11 Hath a nation changed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gods,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet no gods? but my people have
                            changed their glory
                            for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>doth
                            not profit.</p>
                        <p>12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith
                            the Lord.</p>
                        <p>13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living
                            waters,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hewed them out cisterns, broken
                            cisterns, that can hold no water.</p>
                        <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Israel a
                            servant?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he a

                        <p>15 The young lions roared upon him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yelled,
                            and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</p>
                        <p>16 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.</p>
                        <p>17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the

                        <p>18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what
                            hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?</p>
                        <p>19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know
                            therefore and see
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an

                        <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For of old time I have broken thy
                            yoke,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I
                            will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest,
                            playing the harlot.</p>
                        <p>21 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into
                            the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</p>
                        <p>22 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much
                            soap,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine iniquity is marked before me,
                            saith the Lord God.</p>
                        <p>23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the
                            valley, know what thou hast
                            done:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            swift dromedary traversing her ways;</p>
                        <p>24 A wild ass used to the
                            wilderness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>snuffeth up the wind at her
                            pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary
                            themselves; in her month they shall find her.</p>
                        <p>25 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is
                            no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</p>
                        <p>26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their
                            kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</p>
                        <p>27 Saying to a stock, Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my father; and to
                            a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have
                            turned<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>back unto me, and
                            not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>face: but in the time of their
                            trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</p>
                        <p>28 But where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy gods that thou hast made
                            thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble:
                            for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</p>
                        <p>29 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>30 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath
                            devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</p>
                        <p>31<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O generation, see ye the word of the Lord. Have I been a
                            wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will
                            come no more unto thee?</p>
                        <p>32 Can a maid forget her ornaments,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a bride
                            her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</p>
                        <p>33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones
                            thy ways.</p>
                        <p>34 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found
                            it by secret search, but upon all these.</p>
                        <p>35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I
                            will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</p>
                        <p>36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as
                            thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</p>
                        <p>37 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.

                        <p>THEY say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man&rsquo;s,
                            shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast
                            played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the
                            ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the
                            land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</p>
                        <p>3 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou
                            hadst a whore&rsquo;s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</p>
                        <p>4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father,
                            thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the guide of my youth?</p>
                        <p>5 Will he
                            reserve<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>anger</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for
                            ever? will he keep<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the end? Behold, thou
                            hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.</p>
                        <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said also unto me in the days of Josiah
                            the king, Hast thou seen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which backsliding
                            Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and
                            there hath played the harlot.</p>
                        <p>7 And I said after she had done all these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, Turn thou unto
                            me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah
                            saw<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                        <p>8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put
                            her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but
                            went and played the harlot also.</p>
                        <p>9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and
                            committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</p>
                        <p>10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole
                            heart, but feignedly, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>11 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself
                            more than treacherous Judah.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
                            thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                            will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>merciful, saith the
                            Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will not
                            keep<span>&nbsp;</span><em>anger</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for ever.</p>
                        <p>13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every
                            green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will take
                            you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</p>
                        <p>15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge
                            and understanding.</p>
                        <p>16 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,
                            saith the Lord, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord: neither shall
                            it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they
                            visit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it;</em>neither
                            shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be done any more.</p>
                        <p>17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall
                            be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more
                            after the imagination of their evil heart.</p>
                        <p>18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come
                            together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto
                            your fathers.</p>
                        <p>19 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a
                            goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and
                            shalt not turn away from me.</p>
                        <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Surely<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a wife
                            treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of
                            Israel, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>21 A voice was heard upon the high places,
                            weeping<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>supplications of the children of
                            Israel: for they have perverted their
                            way,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they have forgotten the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God.</p>
                        <p>22 Return, ye backsliding children,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will
                            heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for
                            thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God.

                        <p>25 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and
                            have not obeyed the voice of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God.</p>

                            chariots<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                            a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.</p>
                        <p>14 O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall
                            thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</p>
                        <p>15 For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.</p>
                        <p>16 Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against
                            Jerusalem,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>watchers come from a far
                            country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</p>
                        <p>17 As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious
                            against me, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>18 Thy way and thy doings have procured
                            these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto thee;
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy wickedness, because it is bitter,
                            because it reacheth unto thine heart.</p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
                            maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound
                            of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</p>
                        <p>20 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my
                            tents spoiled,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my curtains in a moment.</p>
                        <p>21 How long shall I see the standard,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hear
                            the sound of the trumpet?</p>
                        <p>22 For my people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>foolish, they have not known
                            me; they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>sottish children, and they have
                            none understanding: they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wise to do evil,
                            but to do good they have no knowledge.</p>
                        <p>23 I beheld the earth, and,
                            lo,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>without
                            form, and void; and the heavens, and
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no light.</p>
                        <p>24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.</p>
                        <p>25 I beheld, and,
                            lo,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</p>
                        <p>26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the
                            Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by his fierce anger.</p>
                        <p>27 For thus hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will
                            I not make a full end.</p>
                        <p>28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have
                            spoken<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, I have purposed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and
                            will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</p>
                        <p>29 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into
                            thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every
                            city<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forsaken,
                            and not a man dwell therein.</p>
                        <p>30
                            And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>when</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>spoiled,
                            what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with
                            ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make
                            thyself fair;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lovers will despise thee,
                            they will seek thy life.</p>
                        <p>31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in
                            travail,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the anguish as of her that
                            bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of
                            Zion,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bewaileth
                            herself,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>spreadeth her
                            hands,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>,
                            Woe<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>me now! for my soul is wearied because
                            of murderers.</p>

                        <p>RUN ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the
                            broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there
                            be<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that executeth judgment, that seeketh
                            the truth; and I will pardon it.</p>
                        <p>2 And though they say, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth; surely they swear falsely.</p>
                        <p>3 O Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not thine eyes upon the truth?
                            thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they have refused to receive
                            correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</p>
                        <p>4 Therefore I said, Surely these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>poor; they
                            are foolish: for they know not the way of the
                            Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nor</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the judgment of their God.</p>
                        <p>5 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of
                            the Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the judgment of their God: but
                            these have altogether broken the
                            yoke,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>burst the bonds.</p>
                        <p>6 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a wolf of the evenings shall spoil
                            them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn
                            in pieces: because their transgressions are
                            many,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their backslidings are increased.</p>
                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me,
                            and sworn
                            by<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled
                            themselves by troops in the harlots&rsquo; houses.</p>
                        <p>8 They were<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fed horses in the morning: every
                            one neighed after his neighbour&rsquo;s wife.</p>
                        <p>9 Shall I not visit for these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>saith the
                            Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end:
                            take away her battlements; for they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not the

                        <p>11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me,
                            saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>12 They have belied the Lord, and
                            said,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not he;
                            neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:</p>
                        <p>13 And the prophets shall become wind, and the
                            word<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not in them: thus shall it be done unto
                            them.</p>
                        <p>14 Wherefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of hosts, Because ye speak this word,
                            behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour
                            them.</p>
                        <p>15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the Lord:
                            it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a mighty nation,
                            it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an ancient nation, a nation whose
                            language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.</p>
                        <p>16 Their quiver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as an open sepulchre,
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all mighty men.</p>
                        <p>17 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy
                            bread,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy sons and thy daughters should
                            eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig
                            trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.</p>
                        <p>18 Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not make a full end with you.</p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God all
                            these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto us? then shalt thou answer
                            them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve
                            strangers in a
                            land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                            yours.</p>
                        <p>20 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</p>
                        <p>21 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not;
                            which have ears, and hear not:</p>
                        <p>22 Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the
                            sand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the bound of the sea by a perpetual
                            decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they
                            not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?</p>
                        <p>23 But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</p>
                        <p>24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God, that
                            giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the
                            appointed weeks of the harvest.</p>
                        <p>25<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your iniquities have turned away
                            these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, and your sins have withholden
                            good<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from you.</p>
                        <p>26 For among my people are found
                            wicked<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they lay wait, as he that setteth
                            snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</p>
                        <p>27 As a cage is full of birds, so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their
                            houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.</p>
                        <p>28 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not
                            the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they
                            not judge.</p>
                        <p>29 Shall I not visit for these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>saith the

                        <p>30<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;</p>
                        <p>31 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people
                            love<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>so:

                            away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</p>
                        <p>5 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</p>
                        <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thus hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts said, Hew ye down
                            trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem:
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the city to be visited;
                            she<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wholly oppression in the midst of her.
                        </p>
                        <p>7 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil
                            is heard in her; before me continually<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>grief
                            and wounds.</p>
                        <p>8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate,
                            a land not inhabited.</p>
                        <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, They shall
                            throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer
                            into the baskets.</p>
                        <p>10 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their
                            ear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:
                            behold, the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>is unto them a reproach; they have no delight
                            in it.</p>
                        <p>11 Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it
                            out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the
                            husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged
                            with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>full
                            of days.</p>
                        <p>12 And their houses shall be turned unto
                            others,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fields
                            and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith
                            the Lord.</p>
                        <p>13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every
                            one<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>given to covetousness; and from the
                            prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</p>
                        <p>14 They have healed also the
                            hurt<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>daughter</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                            my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace;
                            when<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed,
                            neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the
                            time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I visit them they shall be cast down,
                            saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>16 Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths,
                            where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the good way, and walk therein, and ye
                            shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not
                            walk<span>&nbsp;</span><em>therein</em>.</p>
                        <p>17 Also I set watchmen over you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Hearken to the sound of
                            the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</p>
                        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation,
                            what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among them.</p>
                        <p>19 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this
                            people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the fruit of their thoughts,
                            because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</p>
                        <p>20 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far
                            country? your burnt offerings<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                            acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</p>
                        <p>21 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and
                            the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall
                            perish.</p>
                        <p>22 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation
                            shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</p>
                        <p>23 They shall lay hold on bow and spear;
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cruel, and have no mercy; their voice
                            roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O
                            daughter of Zion.</p>
                        <p>24 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of
                            us,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
                        <p>25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the
                            enemy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on
                            every side.</p>
                        <p>26<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O daughter of my people,
                            gird<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in
                            ashes: make thee
                            mourning,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                            only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</p>
                        <p>27 I have set thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            tower<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a fortress among my people, that thou
                            mayest know and try their way.</p>
                        <p>28 They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all grievous revolters, walking with
                            slanders:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brass
                            and iron; they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all corrupters.</p>
                        <p>29 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for
                            the wicked are not plucked away.</p>
                        <p>30 Reprobate silver shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>call them, because
                            the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath rejected them.</p>

                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>THE word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Stand in the gate of the Lord&rsquo;s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear
                            the word of the Lord,
                            all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Judah,
                            that enter in at these gates to worship the Lord.</p>
                        <p>3 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your
                            doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.</p>
                        <p>4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The
                            temple of the Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>these.</p>
                        <p>5 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment
                            between a man and his neighbour;</p>
                        <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><em>If</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye oppress not the stranger, the
                            fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after
                            other gods to your hurt:</p>
                        <p>7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for
                            ever and ever.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.</p>
                        <p>9 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal,
                            and walk after other gods whom ye know not;</p>
                        <p>10 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are
                            delivered to do all these abominations?</p>
                        <p>11 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold,
                            even I have seen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>12 But go ye now unto my place which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                            Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my
                            people Israel.</p>
                        <p>13 And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, and I spake unto you,
                            rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;</p>
                        <p>14 Therefore will I do unto<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>house, which is
                            called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your
                            fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</p>
                        <p>15 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
                            brethren,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the whole seed of Ephraim.</p>
                        <p>16 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither
                            make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.</p>
                        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the
                            streets of Jerusalem?</p>
                        <p>18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women
                            knead<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dough, to make cakes to the queen
                            of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to
                            anger.</p>
                        <p>19 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the
                            Lord:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>provoke</em><span>&nbsp;</span>themselves
                            to the confusion of their own faces?</p>
                        <p>20 Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon
                            this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of
                            the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</p>
                        <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel;
                            Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</p>
                        <p>22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out
                            of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</p>
                        <p>23 But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye
                            shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be
                            well unto you.</p>
                        <p>24 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
                            counsels<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the imagination of their evil
                            heart, and went backward, and not forward.</p>
                        <p>25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have
                            even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and
                            sending<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em></p>
                        <p>26 Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did
                            worse than their fathers.</p>
                        <p>27 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee:
                            thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</p>
                        <p>28 But thou shalt say unto them, This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God, nor receiveth
                            correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</p>
                        <p>29<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cut off thine
                            hair,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>O</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Jerusalem</em>, and
                            cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away, and take up a lamentation on high
                            places; for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his
                            wrath.</p>
                        <p>30 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the Lord: they have set their
                            abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</p>
                        <p>31 And they have built the high places of Tophet,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to
                            burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I
                            commanded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not, neither came it into my
                            heart.</p>
                        <p>32<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no
                            more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for
                            they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.</p>
                        <p>33 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the
                            beasts of the earth; and none shall
                            fray<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away.</p>
                        <p>34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem,
                            the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of
                            the bride: for the land shall be desolate.</p>

                        <p>AT that time, saith the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the
                            bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the
                            bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:</p>
                        <p>2 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom
                            they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they
                            have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they
                            shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.</p>
                        <p>3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this
                            evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; Shall they
                            fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?</p>
                        <p>5 Why<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is this people of Jerusalem slidden
                            back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</p>
                        <p>6 I hearkened and heard,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they spake not
                            aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to
                            his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.</p>
                        <p>7 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and
                            the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p>8 How do ye say, We<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wise, and the law of the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with us? Lo, certainly in vain made
                            he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the pen of the
                            scribes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in vain.</p>
                        <p>9 The wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are ashamed, they are dismayed
                            and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what
                            wisdom<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in them?</p>
                        <p>10 Therefore will I give their wives unto
                            others,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their fields to them that shall
                            inherit<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for every one from the least even
                            unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one
                            dealeth falsely.</p>
                        <p>11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace;
                            when<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed,
                            neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of
                            their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will surely consume them, saith the
                            Lord:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade;
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                            have given them shall pass away from them.</p>
                        <p>14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and
                            let us be silent there: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God hath put us to silence, and
                            given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the Lord.</p>
                        <p>15 We looked for peace, but no
                            good<span>&nbsp;</span><em>came;</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for a
                            time of health, and behold trouble!</p>
                        <p>16 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the
                            neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is
                            in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.</p>
                        <p>17 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>will</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>charmed,
                            and they shall bite you, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>When</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I would comfort myself against
                            sorrow, my heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>faint in me.</p>
                        <p>19 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a
                            far country:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in Zion?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not her king
                            in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven
                            images,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with strange vanities?</p>
                        <p>20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</p>
                        <p>21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken
                            hold on me.</p>
                        <p>22<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no balm
                            in

                        <p>OH that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and
                            night for the slain of the daughter of my people!</p>
                        <p>2 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my
                            people, and go from them! for they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all
                            adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</p>
                        <p>3 And they bend their tongues<span>&nbsp;</span><em>like</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their
                            bow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lies: but they are not valiant for the
                            truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p>4 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother
                            will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</p>
                        <p>5 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have
                            taught their tongue to speak lies,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>weary

                        <p>7 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try
                            them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</p>
                        <p>8 Their

                            arrow shot out; it speaketh
                            deceit:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>speaketh peaceably to his neighbour
                            with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.</p>
                        <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shall I not visit them for
                            these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things?</em><span>&nbsp;</span>saith the Lord: shall not my soul
                            be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
                        <p>10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the
                            wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass
                            through<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>neither

                        <p>11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a den of
                            dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</p>

                            whom the mouth of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what
                            the land perisheth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is burned up like a
                            wilderness, that none passeth through?</p>
                        <p>13 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before
                            them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;</p>
                        <p>14 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their
                            fathers taught them:</p>
                        <p>15 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
                            will feed them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this people, with
                            wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</p>
                        <p>16 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have
                            known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.</p>
                        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, Consider ye, and
                            call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for
                            cunning<span>&nbsp;</span><em>women</em>, that they may come:</p>
                        <p>18 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with
                            tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</p>
                        <p>19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly
                            confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have
                            cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out.</p>
                        <p>20 Yet hear the word of the Lord, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth,
                            and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.</p>
                        <p>21 For death is come up into our windows,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is
                            entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from
                            without,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the young men from the streets.
                        </p>
                        <p>22 Speak, Thus saith the Lord, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open
                            field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall
                            gather<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>.</p>
                        <p>23<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Let not the
                            wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory in his wisdom, neither let the
                            mighty<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory in his might, let not the
                            rich<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory in his riches:</p>
                        <p>24 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>which exercise
                            lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in
                            these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I delight, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>25<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will punish

                        <p>HEAR ye the word which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of
                            heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>
                        <p>3 For the customs of the people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vain:
                            for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cutteth a tree out of the forest, the
                            work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</p>
                        <p>4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it
                            move not.</p>
                        <p>5 They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upright as the palm tree, but speak
                            not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they
                            cannot do evil, neither
                            also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in them
                            to do good.</p>
                        <p>6 Forasmuch
                            as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                            like unto thee, O Lord; thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great, and thy
                            name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great in might.</p>
                        <p>7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as
                            among all the wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the nations, and in
                            all their
                            kingdoms,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                            like unto thee.</p>
                        <p>8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the
                            stock<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a doctrine of vanities.</p>
                        <p>9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the
                            workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and
                            purple<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their clothing:
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the work of
                            cunning<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>.</p>
                        <p>10 But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the true God,
                            he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the living God, and an everlasting king:
                            at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his
                            indignation.</p>
                        <p>11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the
                            earth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they shall perish from the earth,
                            and from under these heavens.</p>
                        <p>12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath
                            stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</p>
                        <p>13 When he uttereth his
                            voice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of
                            the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
                        </p>
                        <p>14 Every man is brutish in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>knowledge: every
                            founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten
                            image<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>falsehood,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            breath in them.</p>
                        <p>15
                            They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>
                        <p>16 The portion of Jacob<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not like them: for
                            he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the former of
                            all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and
                            Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the rod of his inheritance: The
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name.
                        </p>
                        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
                        </p>
                        <p>18 For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this
                            once, and will distress them, that they may
                            find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>.</p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a grief, and I must bear it.</p>
                        <p>20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me,
                            and
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none
                            to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</p>
                        <p>21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the Lord: therefore they shall not
                            prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</p>
                        <p>22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to
                            make the cities of Judah desolate,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a den of
                            dragons.</p>
                        <p>23<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O Lord, I know that the way of
                            man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not in
                            himself:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                            in man that walketh to direct his steps.</p>
                        <p>24 O Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not
                            on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made
                            his habitation desolate.</p>

                        <p>THE word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants
                            of Jerusalem;</p>
                        <p>3 And say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel;
                            Cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the man that obeyeth not the words of
                            this covenant,</p>
                        <p>4 Which I commanded your fathers in the
                            day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I brought them forth out of the land
                            of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which
                            I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:</p>
                        <p>5 That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land
                            flowing with milk and honey,
                            as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this day.
                            Then answered I, and said, So be it, O Lord.</p>
                        <p>6 Then the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of
                            Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do
                            them.</p>
                        <p>7 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the
                            day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I brought them up out of the land of
                            Egypt,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto this day, rising early and
                            protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</p>
                        <p>8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of
                            their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I
                            commanded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to do; but they
                            did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not.</p>
                        <p>9 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah,
                            and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my
                            words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of
                            Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon
                            them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not
                            hearken unto them.</p>
                        <p>12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto
                            whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
                        </p>
                        <p>13
                            For<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah;
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars
                            to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shameful
                            thing,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>altars to burn incense unto Baal.
                        </p>
                        <p>14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I
                            will not hear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the time that they cry
                            unto me for their trouble.</p>
                        <p>15 What hath my beloved to do in mine
                            house,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>seeing</em><span>&nbsp;</span>she hath wrought lewdness with
                            many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</p>
                        <p>16 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>called thy name, A green olive tree,
                            fair,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of goodly fruit: with the noise of a
                            great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</p>
                        <p>17 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against
                            thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done
                            against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</p>
                        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given me
                            knowledge<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and I
                            know<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>then thou shewedst me their doings.
                        </p>
                        <p>19 But I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like a
                            lamb<span>&nbsp;</span><em>or</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an
                            ox<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is brought to the slaughter; and I knew
                            not that they had devised devices against me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Let us
                            destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living,
                            that his name may be no more remembered.</p>
                        <p>20 But, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins
                            and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</p>
                        <p>21 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy
                            life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord, that thou die not by our hand:</p>
                        <p>22 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the
                            young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:</p>
                        <p>23 And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of

                        <p>RIGHTEOUS<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou, O Lord, when I plead with
                            thee: yet let me talk with thee
                            of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the
                            wicked prosper?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>wherefore</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are all they happy
                            that deal very treacherously?</p>
                        <p>2 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit:
                            thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near in their mouth, and far from
                            their reins.</p>
                        <p>3 But thou, O Lord, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull
                            them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</p>
                        <p>4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of
                            them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall
                            not see our last end.</p>
                        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then
                            how canst thou contend with horses? and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                            the land of peace,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>wherein</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou
                            trustedst,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>wearied</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em>,
                            then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</p>
                        <p>6 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with
                            thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair
                            words unto thee.</p>
                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given
                            the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</p>
                        <p>8 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have
                            I hated it.</p>
                        <p>9 Mine heritage<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                            me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a speckled bird, the birds round
                            about<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against her; come ye, assemble all
                            the beasts of the field, come to devour.</p>
                        <p>10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they
                            have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</p>
                        <p>11 They have made it
                            desolate,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>desolate
                            it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man
                            layeth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to heart.</p>
                        <p>12 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall devour from
                            the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>end of the land even to
                            the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>end of the land: no flesh shall have
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>13 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to
                            pain,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall not profit: and they shall be
                            ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>against all mine evil
                            neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit;
                            Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among
                            them.</p>
                        <p>15 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have
                            compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to
                            his land.</p>
                        <p>16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear
                            by my name, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal;
                            then shall they be built in the midst of my people.</p>
                        <p>17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the
                            Lord.</p>

                        <p>THUS saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it
                            upon thy loins, and put it not in water.</p>
                        <p>2 So I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord, and
                            put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on my loins.</p>
                        <p>3 And the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto me the second time, saying,</p>
                        <p>4 Take the girdle that thou hast got,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon thy loins, and arise, go to
                            Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</p>
                        <p>5 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>commanded me.</p>
                        <p>6 And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, Arise,
                            go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.</p>
                        <p>7 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid
                            it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.</p>
                        <p>8 Then the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto me, saying,</p>
                        <p>9 Thus saith the Lord, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride
                            of Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>10 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their
                            heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this
                            girdle, which is good for nothing.</p>
                        <p>11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the
                            whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the Lord; that they might be unto
                            me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
                        </p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall
                            say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?</p>
                        <p>13 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will fill all the
                            inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David&rsquo;s throne, and the
                            priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</p>
                        <p>14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith
                            the Lord: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken.</p>
                        <p>16 Give glory to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God, before he cause darkness, and before
                            your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the
                            shadow of
                            death,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gross
                            darkness.</p>
                        <p>17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places
                            for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pride; and mine eye shall weep sore,
                            and run down with tears, because the Lord&rsquo;s flock is carried away captive.</p>
                        <p>18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities
                            shall come down,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the crown of your glory.
                        </p>
                        <p>19 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall
                            open<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Judah shall be carried away captive
                            all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.</p>
                        <p>20 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:
                            where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            flock<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
                        </p>
                        <p>21 What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught
                            them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>captains,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                            chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?</p>
                        <p>22<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon
                            me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts
                            discovered,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy heels made bare.</p>
                        <p>23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his

                            accustomed to do evil.</p>
                        <p>24 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the
                            wilderness.</p>
                        <p>25 This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy lot, the portion of thy measures
                            from me, saith the Lord; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</p>
                        <p>26 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.</p>
                        <p>27 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy
                            whoredom,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine abominations on the hills
                            in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean?
                            when<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>once<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be?</em>

                        <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.</p>
                        <p>2 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry
                            of Jerusalem is gone up.</p>
                        <p>3 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the
                            pits,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>found no water; they returned with
                            their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.</p>
                        <p>4 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed,
                            they covered their heads.</p>
                        <p>5 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, because
                            there was no grass.</p>
                        <p>6 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons;
                            their eyes did fail,
                            because<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no

                            backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.</p>
                        <p>8 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a
                            stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring
                            man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>turneth aside to tarry for a night?
                        </p>
                        <p>9 Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty
                            man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cannot save? yet thou, O

                            by thy name; leave us not.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto this people, Thus have
                            they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit
                            their sins.</p>
                        <p>11 Then said the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto me, Pray not for this people
                            for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good.</p>
                        <p>12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an
                            oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine,
                            and by the pestilence.</p>
                        <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye
                            shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in
                            this place.</p>
                        <p>14 Then the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I
                            sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto
                            you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.</p>
                        <p>15 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>concerning the prophets that prophesy in
                            my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By
                            sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</p>
                        <p>16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because
                            of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor
                            their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.</p>
                        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run
                            down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people
                            is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</p>
                        <p>18 If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into
                            the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest
                            go about into a land that they know not.</p>
                        <p>19 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            healing for us? we looked for peace,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</p>
                        <p>20 We acknowledge, O Lord, our
                            wickedness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the iniquity of our fathers:
                            for we have sinned against thee.</p>
                        <p>21 Do not abhor<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em>, for thy name&rsquo;s sake, do not disgrace the
                            throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</p>
                        <p>22 Are there<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>among the vanities of the
                            Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give
                            showers?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not thou he, O
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all
                            these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>.</p>

                        <p>THEN said the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before
                            me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                            mind<span>&nbsp;</span><em>could</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>toward

                            them go forth.</p>
                        <p>2 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou
                            shalt tell them, Thus saith the Lord; Such
                            as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for death, to death; and such
                            as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for the sword, to the sword; and such
                            as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for the famine, to the famine; and such

                        <p>3 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the Lord: the sword to slay, and the dogs to
                            tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</p>
                        <p>4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the
                            son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which
                            he did in Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>5 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go
                            aside to ask how thou doest?</p>
                        <p>6 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out
                            my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</p>
                        <p>7 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will
                            bereave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of children, I will destroy my
                            people,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>since</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they return not from their ways.
                        </p>
                        <p>8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them
                            against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have
                            caused<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to fall upon it suddenly, and
                            terrors upon the city.</p>
                        <p>9 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down
                            while<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>yet
                            day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the
                            sword before their enemies, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and
                            a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to
                            me on usury;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>every one of them doth curse

                        <p>11 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will
                            cause the enemy to entreat thee<span>&nbsp;</span><em>well</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                            time of evil and in the time of affliction.</p>

                        <p>13 Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for all thy sins, even in all thy
                            borders.</p>
                        <p>14 And I will make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to pass with thine
                            enemies into a land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou knowest not: for
                            a fire is kindled in mine anger,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall
                            burn upon you.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O Lord, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of
                            my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have
                            suffered rebuke.</p>
                        <p>16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing
                            of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of hosts.</p>
                        <p>17 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand:
                            for thou hast filled me with indignation.</p>
                        <p>18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound
                            incurable,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>refuseth to be healed? wilt
                            thou be altogether unto me as a
                            liar,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>waters<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fail?
                        </p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou return, then will I bring
                            thee again,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt stand before me: and
                            if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return
                            unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</p>
                        <p>20 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against
                            thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee to save thee and to deliver
                            thee, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the
                            hand of the terrible.</p>

                        <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came also unto me, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.
                        </p>
                        <p>3 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>concerning the sons and concerning the daughters
                            that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning
                            their fathers that begat them in this land;</p>
                        <p>4 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be
                            buried;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they shall be as dung upon the face

                            shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.</p>
                        <p>5 For thus saith the Lord, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor
                            bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the

                        <p>6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither

                            them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither
                            shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>give them the cup of consolation to
                            drink for their father or for their mother.</p>
                        <p>8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>9 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause
                            to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice
                            of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all

                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>pronounced all this great evil against us? or
                            what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our iniquity? or
                            what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our sin that we have committed against
                            the Lordour God?</p>
                        <p>11 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the Lord, and
                            have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have
                            forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</p>
                        <p>12 And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the
                            imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:</p>
                        <p>13 Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know
                            not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neither</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye nor your fathers; and there
                            shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.</p>
                        <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no
                            more be said, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out
                            of the land of Egypt;</p>
                        <p>15 But, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the
                            land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them
                            again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</p>
                        <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they
                            shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every
                            mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</p>
                        <p>17 For mine eyes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon all their ways: they
                            are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.</p>
                        <p>18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled
                            my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and
                            abominable things.</p>
                        <p>19 O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles
                            shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have
                            inherited lies, vanity,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wherein<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            profit.</p>
                        <p>20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no gods?</p>
                        <p>21 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine
                            hand and my might; and they shall know that my
                            name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>The Lord.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>16 As for me, I have not hastened from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came

                        <p>17 Be not a terror unto me: thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my hope in

                        <p>18 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be
                            dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with
                            double destruction.</p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus said the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto me; Go and stand in the
                            gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which
                            they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;</p>
                        <p>20 And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all
                            the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</p>
                        <p>21 Thus saith the Lord; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor
                            bring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in by the gates of Jerusalem;</p>
                        <p>22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any
                            work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.</p>
                        <p>23 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they
                            might not hear, nor receive instruction.</p>
                        <p>24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the Lord, to bring in
                            no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to
                            do no work therein;</p>
                        <p>25 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the
                            throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of
                            Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.</p>
                        <p>26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and
                            from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south,
                            bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing
                            sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden,
                            even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in
                            the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be
                            quenched.</p>

                        <p>THE word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Arise, and go down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my
                            words.</p>
                        <p>3 Then I went down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
                        </p>
                        <p>4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it
                            again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>5 Then the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came to me, saying,</p>
                        <p>6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the Lord. Behold, as the
                            clay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the potter&rsquo;s hand,
                            so<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.</p>
                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;</span><em>At</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>what</em><span>&nbsp;</span>instant I
                            shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down,
                            and to destroy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it;</em></p>
                        <p>8 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the
                            evil that I thought to do unto them.</p>
                        <p>9 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>at</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>what</em><span>&nbsp;</span>instant
                            I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to
                            plant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it;</em></p>
                        <p>10 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good,
                            wherewith I said I would benefit them.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
                            inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I frame evil against you, and
                            devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways
                            and your doings good.</p>
                        <p>12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every
                            one do the imagination of his evil heart.</p>
                        <p>13 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things:
                            the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.</p>
                        <p>14 Will<span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em><span>&nbsp;</span>leave
                            the snow of

                            flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?</p>
                        <p>15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have
                            caused them to stumble in their ways<span>&nbsp;</span><em>from</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            ancient paths, to walk in paths,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a way not
                            cast up;</p>
                        <p>16 To make their land desolate,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a perpetual
                            hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.</p>
                        <p>17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and
                            not the face, in the day of their calamity.</p>
                        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
                            for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from
                            the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of
                            his words.</p>
                        <p>19 Give heed to me, O Lord, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.</p>
                        <p>20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that
                            I stood before thee to speak good for
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to turn away thy wrath from them.</p>
                        <p>21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out
                            their<span>&nbsp;</span><em>blood</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the force of the sword; and let
                            their wives be bereaved of their children,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>widows; and let their men be put to
                            death;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>let</em><span>&nbsp;</span>their young
                            men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>slain by the sword in battle.</p>
                        <p>22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them:
                            for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.</p>
                        <p>23 Yet, Lord, thou knowest all their counsel against me to
                            slay<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forgive not their iniquity, neither
                            blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee;
                            deal<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thus</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with them in the time of thine anger.

                        <p>THUS saith the Lord, Go and get a potter&rsquo;s earthen bottle,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>take</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the ancients of the people, and of
                            the ancients of the priests;</p>
                        <p>2 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the entry of the east gate, and
                            proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,</p>
                        <p>3 And say, Hear ye the word of the Lord, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus
                            saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon
                            this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.</p>
                        <p>4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it
                            unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and
                            have filled this place with the blood of innocents;</p>
                        <p>5 They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with
                            fire<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>burnt offerings unto Baal, which I
                            commanded not, nor spake<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, neither
                            came<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into my mind:</p>
                        <p>6 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that this place shall no more be called
                            Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.</p>
                        <p>7 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause
                            them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their
                            lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the
                            beasts of the earth.</p>
                        <p>8 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be
                            astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.</p>
                        <p>9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and
                            they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith
                            their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.</p>
                        <p>10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,</p>
                        <p>11 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; Even so will I
                            break this people and this city,
                            as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>breaketh a potter&rsquo;s vessel, that
                            cannot be made whole again: and they shall
                            bury<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Tophet,
                            till<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            place to bury.</p>
                        <p>12 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the Lord, and to the inhabitants thereof,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>make this city as Tophet:</p>
                        <p>13 And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the
                            place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto
                            all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.</p>
                        <p>14 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had sent him to
                            prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord&rsquo;s house; and said to all the people,
                        </p>
                        <p>15 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring
                            upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it,
                            because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.</p>

                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>NOW Pashur the son of Immer the priest,
                            who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also chief governor in the house of the
                            Lord, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.</p>
                        <p>2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the high gate of Benjamin,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the house of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks.
                            Then said Jeremiah unto him, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath not called thy name Pashur, but
                            Magor-missabib.</p>
                        <p>4 For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy
                            friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall
                            behold<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and I will give all Judah into the
                            hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay
                            them with the sword.</p>
                        <p>5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all
                            the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into
                            the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
                        </p>
                        <p>6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt
                            come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy
                            friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.</p>
                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>O Lord, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art
                            stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.</p>
                        <p>8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.</p>
                        <p>9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name.
                            But<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>word</em><span>&nbsp;</span>was in
                            mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I
                            could not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>stay</em>.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side.
                            Report,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>say</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em>, and we will report
                            it. All my familiars watched for my halting,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Peradventure
                            he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
                        </p>
                        <p>11 But the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with me as a mighty terrible
                            one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be
                            greatly ashamed; for they shall not
                            prosper:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>everlasting confusion shall
                            never be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>12 But, O Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, that triest the
                            righteous,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>seest the reins and the heart,
                            let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.</p>
                        <p>13 Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from
                            the hand of evildoers.</p>
                        <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the day
                            wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.</p>
                        <p>15 Cursed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the man who brought tidings to my
                            father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.</p>
                        <p>16 And let that man be as the cities which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>overthrew, and repented
                            not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;</p>
                        <p>17 Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her
                            womb<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>always

                        <p>18 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be

                        <p>THE word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the
                            son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Inquire, I pray thee, of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of
                            Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will deal with us
                            according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.</p>
                        <p>3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</p>
                        <p>4 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons
                            of war that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in your hands, wherewith ye
                            fight against the king of Babylon,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>against</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Chaldeans, which besiege you
                            without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.</p>
                        <p>5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even
                            in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</p>
                        <p>6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a
                            great pestilence.</p>
                        <p>7 And afterward, saith the Lord, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and
                            the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from
                            the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their
                            enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the
                            edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I
                            set before you the way of life, and the way of death.</p>
                        <p>9 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the
                            pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall
                            live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.</p>
                        <p>10 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord: it

                            shall become a desolation.</p>
                        <p>6 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto the king&rsquo;s house of Judah;
                            Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Gilead unto
                            me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the head of
                            Lebanon:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>surely I will make thee a
                            wilderness,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cities<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are
                            not inhabited.</p>
                        <p>7 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut
                            down thy choice cedars, and cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into the
                            fire.</p>
                        <p>8 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour,
                            Wherefore hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>done thus unto this great city?</p>
                        <p>9 Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan
                            him:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>weep sore for him that goeth away: for
                            he shall return no more, nor see his native country.</p>
                        <p>11 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of
                            Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He
                            shall not return thither any more:</p>
                        <p>12 But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land
                            no more.</p>
                        <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his
                            chambers by wrong;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>useth his
                            neighbour&rsquo;s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;</p>
                        <p>14 That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows;
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cieled
                            with cedar, and painted with vermilion.</p>
                        <p>15 Shalt thou reign, because thou
                            closest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thyself</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in cedar? did not thy father
                            eat and drink, and do judgment and
                            justice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>then<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>well
                            with him?</p>
                        <p>16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
                            then<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>well<span>&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>him:</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                            this to know me? saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>17 But thine eyes and thine heart<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not but
                            for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence,
                            to do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                        <p>18 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
                            king of Judah; They shall not lament for him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Ah my
                            brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Ah
                            lord! or, Ah his glory!</p>
                        <p>19 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of
                            Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and
                            cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.</p>
                        <p>21 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou
                            saidst, I will not hear.
                            This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy
                            manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.</p>
                        <p>22 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then
                            shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.</p>
                        <p>23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be
                            when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!</p>
                        <p>24<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I live, saith the Lord, though Coniah the
                            son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee
                            thence;</p>
                        <p>25 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the
                            hand<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>whose
                            face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
                            of the Chaldeans.</p>
                        <p>26 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye
                            were not born; and there shall ye die.</p>
                        <p>27 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.</p>
                        <p>28<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this man Coniah a despised broken
                            idol?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a vessel
                            wherein<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no pleasure? wherefore are they cast
                            out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</p>
                        <p>29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>30 Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man childless, a
                            man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall not prosper in his days: for no
                            man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in
                            Judah.</p>

                        <p>WOE be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>2 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel against the pastors that feed
                            my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them:
                            behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them,
                            and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.</p>
                        <p>4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more,
                            nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David
                            a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and
                            justice in the earth.</p>
                        <p>6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name whereby he shall be called,
                            THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</p>
                        <p>7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they shall no more say, The
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of
                            Egypt;</p>
                        <p>8 But, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the
                            house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them;
                            and they shall dwell in their own land.</p>
                        <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my
                            bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the
                            Lord, and because of the words of his holiness.</p>
                        <p>10 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the
                            pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their
                            force<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not right.</p>
                        <p>11 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness,
                            saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>12 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as
                            slippery<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ways</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the darkness: they shall be
                            driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the year of their visitation, saith
                            the Lord.</p>
                        <p>13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my
                            people Israel to err.</p>
                        <p>14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and
                            walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his
                            wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
                        </p>
                        <p>15 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold,
                            I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets
                            of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.</p>
                        <p>16 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets
                            that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own
                            heart,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not out of the mouth of the Lord.
                        </p>
                        <p>17 They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath said, Ye shall
                            have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart,
                            No evil shall come upon you.</p>
                        <p>18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath perceived and heard his word? who
                            hath marked his word, and heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it?</em></p>
                        <p>19 Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>is gone forth in fury, even a grievous
                            whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.</p>
                        <p>20 The anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall not return, until he have executed, and till
                            he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it
                            perfectly.</p>
                        <p>21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they
                            prophesied.</p>
                        <p>22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they
                            should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</p>
                        <p>23<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a
                            God afar off?</p>
                        <p>24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do not I
                            fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have
                            dreamed, I have dreamed.</p>
                        <p>26 How long shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be in the heart of the
                            prophets that prophesy lies?
                            yea,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prophets
                            of the deceit of their own heart;</p>
                        <p>27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man
                            to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</p>
                        <p>28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him
                            speak my word faithfully. What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the chaff to
                            the wheat? saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>29<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not my word like as a fire? saith the
                            Lord; and like a hammer<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>breaketh the rock
                            in pieces?</p>
                        <p>30 Therefore, behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against the prophets,
                            saith the Lord, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.</p>
                        <p>31 Behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against the prophets, saith the
                            Lord, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.</p>
                        <p>32 Behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against them that prophesy false
                            dreams, saith the Lord, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by
                            their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit
                            this people at all, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>33<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee,
                            saying, What<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the burden of the Lord? thou
                            shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>34 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will even
                            punish that man and his house.</p>
                        <p>35 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered? and, What hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spoken?</p>
                        <p>36 And the burden of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall ye mention no more: for every
                            man&rsquo;s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of
                            the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts our God.</p>
                        <p>37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>answered thee?
                            and, What hath the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spoken?</p>
                        <p>38 But since ye say, The burden of the Lord; therefore thus saith the Lord; Because ye say
                            this word, The burden of the Lord, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The
                            burden of the Lord;</p>
                        <p>39 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the
                            city that I gave you and your
                            fathers,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>cast</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>you</em><span>&nbsp;</span>out
                            of my presence:</p>
                        <p>40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not
                            be forgotten.</p>

                        <p>THE Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of
                            figs<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>set before the temple of the Lord,
                            after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of
                            Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from
                            Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</p>
                        <p>2 One basket<span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very good
                            figs,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like the
                            figs<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>first
                            ripe: and the other basket<span>&nbsp;</span><em>had</em><span>&nbsp;</span>very naughty
                            figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</p>
                        <p>3 Then said the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs;
                            the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
                        </p>
                        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Again the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto me, saying,
                        </p>
                        <p>5 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them
                            that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of
                            the Chaldeans for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good.</p>
                        <p>6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and
                            I will build them, and not pull<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>down; and
                            I will plant them, and not pluck<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>up.</p>
                        <p>7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord: and they shall be my people, and
                            I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
                            surely thus saith the Lord, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and
                            the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of
                            Egypt:</p>
                        <p>9 And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
                            for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hurt,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.</p>
                        <p>10 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be

                        <p>THE word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of
                            Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king
                            of Babylon;</p>
                        <p>2 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the
                            inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,</p>
                        <p>3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the three and twentieth year, the word
                            of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early
                            and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.</p>
                        <p>4 And the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising
                            early and sending<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but ye have not
                            hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.</p>
                        <p>5 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings,
                            and dwell in the land that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath given unto you and to your
                            fathers for ever and ever:</p>
                        <p>6 And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger
                            with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.</p>
                        <p>7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the Lord; that ye might provoke me to anger with
                            the works of your hands to your own hurt.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; Because
                            ye have not heard my words,</p>
                        <p>9 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and
                            Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and
                            against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly
                            destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.</p>
                        <p>10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of
                            the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of
                            the candle.</p>
                        <p>11 And this whole land shall be a
                            desolation,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an astonishment; and these
                            nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are
                            accomplished,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will punish the king of
                            Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans,
                            and will make it perpetual desolations.</p>
                        <p>13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against
                            it,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all that is written in this book,
                            which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.</p>
                        <p>14 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will
                            recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel unto me;
                            Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee,
                            to drink it.</p>
                        <p>16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send
                            among them.</p>
                        <p>17 Then took I the cup at the Lord&rsquo;s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom
                            the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had sent me:</p>

                            desert,</p>
                        <p>25 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,</p>
                        <p>26 And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of
                            the world, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the face of the
                            earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.</p>
                        <p>27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the
                            God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of
                            the sword which I will send among you.</p>
                        <p>28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou
                            say unto them, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.</p>
                        <p>29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be
                            utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the
                            inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                        <p>30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The

                            habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that

                        <p>33 And the slain of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be at that day

                            lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.</p>
                        <p>34<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow

                            accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.</p>
                        <p>35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.</p>
                        <p>36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the
                            flock,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>heard:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for

                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>IN the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word
                            from the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord; Stand in the court of the Lord&rsquo;s house, and speak unto all the
                            cities of Judah, which come to worship in the Lord&rsquo;s house, all the words that I
                            command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</p>
                        <p>3 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of
                            the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</p>
                        <p>4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in
                            my law, which I have set before you,</p>
                        <p>5 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up
                            early, and sending<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, but ye have not hearkened;</p>
                        <p>6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations
                            of the earth.</p>
                        <p>7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in
                            the house of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all
                            that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>had
                            commanded<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to speak unto all the people,
                            that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely
                            die.</p>
                        <p>9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh,
                            and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered
                            against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up
                            from the king&rsquo;s house unto the house of the Lord, and sat down in the entry of the new
                            gate of the Lord&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;</span><em>house</em>.</p>
                        <p>11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying,
                            This man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>worthy to die; for he hath
                            prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,
                            saying, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>sent me to prophesy against this house and against this
                            city all the words that ye have heard.</p>
                        <p>13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your God; and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>will repent him of the evil
                            that he hath pronounced against you.</p>
                        <p>14 As for me, behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in your hand: do with
                            me as seemeth good and meet unto you.</p>
                        <p>15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood
                            upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</p>
                        <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to
                            the prophets; This man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not worthy to die:
                            for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God.</p>
                        <p>17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the
                            people, saying,</p>
                        <p>18 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all
                            the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; Zion shall be
                            plowed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>like</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a field, and Jerusalem shall become
                            heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</p>
                        <p>19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the
                            Lord, and besought the Lord, and the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>repented him of the evil which
                            he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</p>
                        <p>20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urijah the son of
                            Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according
                            to all the words of Jeremiah:</p>
                        <p>21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his
                            words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and
                            fled, and went into Egypt;</p>
                        <p>22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>namely</em>, Elnathan
                            the son of Achbor, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>certain</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men with him
                            into Egypt.</p>
                        <p>23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who
                            slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</p>
                        <p>24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not
                            give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</p>

                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>IN the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word
                            unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon
                            thy neck,</p>
                        <p>3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the
                            Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers
                            which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;</p>
                        <p>4 And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts,
                            the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;</p>
                        <p>5 I have made the earth, the man and the beast
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the ground, by my great power and
                            by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</p>
                        <p>6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
                            my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</p>
                        <p>7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son&rsquo;s son, until the very time
                            of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.</p>
                        <p>8 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the nation and
                            kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not
                            put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the
                            Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed
                            them by his hand.</p>
                        <p>9 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor
                            to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve
                            the king of Babylon:</p>
                        <p>10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should
                            drive you out, and ye should perish.</p>
                        <p>11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve
                            him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the Lord; and they shall till
                            it, and dwell therein.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
                            words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his
                            people, and live.</p>
                        <p>13 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence,
                            as the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of
                            Babylon?</p>
                        <p>14 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall
                            not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</p>
                        <p>15 For I have not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might
                            drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</p>
                        <p>16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Hearken
                            not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the
                            Lord&rsquo;s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie
                            unto you.</p>
                        <p>17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be
                            laid waste?</p>
                        <p>18 But if they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prophets, and if the word of
                            the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>be with them, let them now make intercession to the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the house of the king of Judah, and at
                            Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts concerning the
                            pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the
                            vessels that remain in this city,</p>
                        <p>20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the
                            son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and
                            Jerusalem;</p>
                        <p>21 Yea, thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the
                            vessels that remain<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the house of the Lord,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the house of the king of Judah and of
                            Jerusalem;</p>
                        <p>22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them,
                            saith the Lord; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</p>

                            in the fourth year,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the fifth

                        <p>3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the
                            Lord&rsquo;s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and
                            carried them to Babylon:</p>
                        <p>4 And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all
                            the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of

                        <p>5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the

                            the Lord,</p>
                        <p>6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>do so: the

                        <p>8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many
                            countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</p>
                        <p>9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to
                            pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall the prophet be known, that the

                            Jeremiah&rsquo;s neck, and brake it.</p>
                        <p>11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Even so
                            will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within
                            the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto
                            Jeremiah<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>prophet</em>, after that
                            Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
                        </p>
                        <p>13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but
                            thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</p>
                        <p>14 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke
                            of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of
                            Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
                            now, Hananiah; The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to
                            trust in a lie.</p>
                        <p>16 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth:
                            this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord.</p>
                        <p>17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.</p>

                        <p>NOW these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the words of the letter that
                            Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried
                            away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom
                            Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;</p>
                        <p>2 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and
                            Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)</p>
                        <p>3 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah
                            king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,</p>
                        <p>4 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are
                            carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;
                        </p>
                        <p>5 Build ye houses, and
                            dwell<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and
                            plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;</p>
                        <p>6 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your
                            daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased
                            there, and not diminished.</p>
                        <p>7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and
                            pray unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of
                            Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst of you, deceive you,
                            neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.</p>
                        <p>9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be accomplished
                            at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return
                            to this place.</p>
                        <p>11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and
                            not of evil, to give you an expected end.</p>
                        <p>12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
                        </p>
                        <p>13 And ye shall seek me, and find<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em>, when ye shall search for me
                            with all your heart.</p>
                        <p>14 And I will be found of you, saith the Lord: and I will turn away your captivity, and I
                            will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you,
                            saith the Lord; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried
                            away captive.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because ye have said, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath raised us up
                            prophets in Babylon;</p>
                        <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Know</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that thus saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the
                            people that dwelleth in this city,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of your
                            brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;</p>
                        <p>17 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword,
                            the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten,
                            they are so evil.</p>
                        <p>18 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and
                            will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an
                            astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven
                            them:</p>
                        <p>19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord, which I sent unto them by my
                            servants the prophets, rising up early and
                            sending<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but ye would not hear, saith the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the captivity,
                            whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:</p>
                        <p>21 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of
                            Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name;
                            Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall
                            slay them before your eyes;</p>
                        <p>22 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Babylon, saying, The
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon
                            roasted in the fire;</p>
                        <p>23 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their
                            neighbours&rsquo; wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded
                            them; even I know, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a witness, saith the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p>24<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>Thus</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah
                            the Nehelamite, saying,</p>
                        <p>25 Thus speaketh the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou
                            hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son
                            of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</p>
                        <p>26 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that
                            ye should be officers in the house of the Lord, for every
                            man<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mad, and
                            maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.</p>
                        <p>27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a
                            prophet to you?</p>
                        <p>28 For therefore he sent unto us<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Babylon,
                            saying,
                            This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>captivity</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>long:
                            build ye houses, and
                            dwell<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and
                            plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
                        <p>29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
                        <p>30<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto Jeremiah,
                            saying,</p>
                        <p>31 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath
                            prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:</p>
                        <p>32 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his
                            seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good
                            that I will do for my people, saith the Lord; because he hath taught rebellion against the
                            Lord.</p>

                        <p>THE word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Thus speaketh the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words
                            that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</p>
                        <p>3 For, lo, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will bring again the captivity of my people
                            Israel and Judah, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to
                            their fathers, and they shall possess it.</p>
                        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And these<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            words that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</p>
                        <p>5 For thus saith the Lord; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</p>
                        <p>6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man
                            with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
                        </p>
                        <p>7 Alas! for that day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great, so that
                            none<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like it:
                            it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>even the time of Jacob&rsquo;s trouble;
                            but he shall be saved out of it.</p>
                        <p>8 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of
                            hosts,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will break his yoke from off thy
                            neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</p>
                        <p>9 But they shall serve the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God, and David their king, whom I
                            will raise up unto them.</p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the Lord;
                            neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the
                            land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and
                            none shall make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>afraid.</p>
                        <p>11 For I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee, saith the Lord, to save
                            thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not
                            make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee
                            altogether unpunished.</p>
                        <p>12 For thus saith the Lord, Thy
                            bruise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>incurable,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy

                            plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</p>
                        <p>14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the
                            wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine
                            iniquity;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>because</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy sins were increased.</p>
                        <p>15 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy
                            sorrow<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>incurable for the multitude of thine
                            iniquity:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>because</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thy sins were increased, I
                            have done these things unto thee.</p>
                        <p>16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every
                            one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all
                            that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</p>
                        <p>17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord;
                            because they called thee an Outcast,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>,
                            This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</p>
                        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of
                            Jacob&rsquo;s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded
                            upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</p>
                        <p>19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I
                            will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not
                            be small.</p>
                        <p>20 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established
                            before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</p>
                        <p>21 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst
                            of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for
                            who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this that engaged his heart to approach
                            unto me? saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>22 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p>
                        <p>23 Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>goeth forth with fury, a continuing
                            whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</p>
                        <p>24 The fierce anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall not return, until he have
                            done<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in
                            the latter days ye shall consider it.</p>

                        <p>AT the same time, saith the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they
                            shall be my people.</p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord, The
                            people<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>left
                            of the sword found grace in the
                            wilderness;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Israel, when I went to cause
                            him to rest.</p>
                        <p>3 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath appeared of old unto me,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>,
                            Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn
                            thee.</p>
                        <p>4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be
                            adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.</p>
                        <p>5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and
                            shall eat<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as common things.</p>
                        <p>6 For there shall be a day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the watchmen
                            upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God.</p>
                        <p>7 For thus saith the Lord; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the
                            nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Lord, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.</p>
                        <p>8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the
                            earth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with them the blind and the lame,
                            the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall
                            return thither.</p>
                        <p>9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to
                            walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a
                            father to Israel, and Ephraim<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my firstborn.
                        </p>
                        <p>10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and
                            declare<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the isles afar off, and say, He
                            that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a
                            shepherd<span>&nbsp;</span><em>doth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his flock.</p>
                        <p>11 For the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand
                            of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>stronger
                            than he.</p>
                        <p>12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the
                            goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock
                            and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any
                            more at all.</p>
                        <p>13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will
                            turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their
                            sorrow.</p>
                        <p>14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied
                            with my goodness, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord; A voice was heard in Ramah,
                            lamentation,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bitter weeping; Rahel weeping
                            for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not.</p>
                        <p>16 Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy
                            work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the
                            enemy.</p>
                        <p>17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to
                            their own border.</p>
                        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning
                            himself<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thus;</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Thou hast chastised me, and I was
                            chastised, as a bullock
                            unaccustomed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>yoke:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>turn
                            thou me, and I shall be turned; for
                            thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>my God.</p>
                        <p>19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote
                            upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even
                            confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.</p>
                        <p>20<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ephraim my dear
                            son?<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore
                            my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the
                            highway,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            way<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of
                            Israel, turn again to these thy cities.</p>
                        <p>22<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
                        </p>
                        <p>23 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use
                            this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their
                            captivity; The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>bless thee, O habitation of
                            justice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mountain of holiness.</p>
                        <p>24 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen,
                            and they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>go forth with flocks.</p>
                        <p>25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.</p>
                        <p>26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.</p>
                        <p>27<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will sow the house
                            of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</p>
                        <p>28 And it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like as I
                            have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy,
                            and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>29 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the
                            children&rsquo;s teeth are set on edge.</p>
                        <p>30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his
                            teeth shall be set on edge.</p>
                        <p>31<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new
                            covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</p>
                        <p>32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the
                            day<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I took them by the hand to bring them
                            out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them,
                            saith the Lord:</p>
                        <p>33 But
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will
                            put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and
                            they shall be my people.</p>
                        <p>34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying,
                            Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
                            saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
                        </p>
                        <p>35<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by
                            day,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the ordinances of the moon and of the
                            stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name:
                        </p>
                        <p>36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the
                            Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the seed of Israel also shall cease
                            from being a nation before me for ever.</p>
                        <p>37 Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth
                            searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have
                            done, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>38<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be
                            built to the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.
                        </p>
                        <p>39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall
                            compass about to Goath.</p>
                        <p>40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the
                            brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the
                            east,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holy
                            unto the Lord; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.</p>

                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>THE word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in the tenth year of Zedekiah
                            king of Judah, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the eighteenth year of
                            Nebuchadrezzar.</p>
                        <p>2 For then the king of Babylon&rsquo;s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was
                            shut up in the court of the prison,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the king of Judah&rsquo;s house.
                        </p>
                        <p>3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say,
                            Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
                            he shall take it;</p>
                        <p>4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall
                            surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to
                            mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</p>
                        <p>5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the
                            Lord: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?</p>
                        <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto
                            me, saying,</p>
                        <p>7 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my
                            field that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Anathoth: for the right of
                            redemption<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine to
                            buy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                        <p>8 So Hanameel mine uncle&rsquo;s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the
                            word of the Lord, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Anathoth,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the country of Benjamin: for the
                            right of inheritance<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine, and the
                            redemption<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thine;
                            buy<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for thyself. Then I knew that
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the word of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle&rsquo;s son,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Anathoth, and weighed him the
                            money,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>seventeen shekels of silver.</p>
                        <p>10 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and took
                            witnesses, and weighed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the money in the
                            balances.</p>
                        <p>11 So I took the evidence of the
                            purchase,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>both</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that which was
                            sealed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>according</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the law and custom, and
                            that which was open:</p>
                        <p>12 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of
                            Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;</span><em>son</em>, and in
                            the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews
                            that sat in the court of the prison.</p>
                        <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</p>
                        <p>14 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences,
                            this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and
                            put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.</p>
                        <p>15 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields
                            and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.</p>
                        <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch
                            the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>17 Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and
                            stretched out arm,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there is nothing too
                            hard for thee:</p>
                        <p>18 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers
                            into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name,
                        </p>
                        <p>19 Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine
                            eyes<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>open upon all the ways of the sons of
                            men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</p>
                        <p>20 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of
                            Egypt,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto this day, and in Israel, and
                            among<span>&nbsp;</span><em>other</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men; and hast made thee a name, as
                            at this day;</p>
                        <p>21 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with
                            wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</p>
                        <p>22 And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a
                            land flowing with milk and honey;</p>
                        <p>23 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy
                            law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast
                            caused all this evil to come upon them:</p>
                        <p>24 Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the
                            hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and
                            of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou
                            seest<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                        <p>25 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord God, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses;
                            for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</p>
                        <p>26<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto Jeremiah,
                            saying,</p>
                        <p>27 Behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord, the God of all flesh:
                            is there any thing too hard for me?</p>
                        <p>28 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the
                            Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</p>
                        <p>29 And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and
                            burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured
                            out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</p>
                        <p>30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from
                            their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of
                            their hands, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>31 For this city hath been to me<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day;
                            that I should remove it from before my face,</p>
                        <p>32 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they
                            have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their
                            prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up
                            early and teaching<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, yet they have not hearkened to receive
                            instruction.</p>
                        <p>34 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
                        </p>
                        <p>35 And they built the high places of Baal,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
                            to cause their sons and their daughters to pass
                            through<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>fire</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                            Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this
                            abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</p>
                        <p>36<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And now therefore thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel,
                            concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of
                            Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</p>
                        <p>37 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger,
                            and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will
                            cause them to dwell safely:</p>
                        <p>38 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</p>
                        <p>39 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good
                            of them, and of their children after them:</p>
                        <p>40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to
                            do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.
                        </p>
                        <p>41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land
                            assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</p>
                        <p>42 For thus saith the Lord; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so
                            will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</p>
                        <p>43 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye
                            say,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>desolate
                            without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</p>
                        <p>44 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
                            seal<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the
                            places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and
                            in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their
                            captivity to return, saith the Lord.</p>

                        <p>MOREOVER the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he
                            was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>the maker thereof, the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that
                            formed it, to establish it; the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his
                            name;</p>
                        <p>3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou
                            knowest not.</p>
                        <p>4 For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and
                            concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the
                            sword;</p>
                        <p>5 They come to fight with the Chaldeans,
                            but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to fill
                            them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for
                            all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.</p>
                        <p>6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them
                            the abundance of peace and truth.</p>
                        <p>7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will
                            build them, as at the first.</p>
                        <p>8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I
                            will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have
                            transgressed against me.</p>
                        <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before
                            all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they
                            shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto
                            it.</p>
                        <p>10 Thus saith the Lord; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye

                        <p>11 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of
                            the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts: for
                            the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>good; for his

                            sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. For I will cause to return the captivity of
                            the land, as at the first, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>12 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate
                            without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of
                            shepherds causing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>flocks to lie down.</p>
                        <p>13 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south,
                            and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,
                            shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that
                            telleth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>14 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform that good thing which I have
                            promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
                            righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the
                            land.</p>
                        <p>16 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>name</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wherewith
                            she shall be called, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our righteousness.</p>
                        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord; David shall never want a man to sit upon
                            the throne of the house of Israel;</p>
                        <p>18 Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and
                            to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto Jeremiah,
                            saying,</p>
                        <p>20 Thus saith the Lord; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night,
                            and that there should not be day and night in their season;</p>
                        <p>21<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>may also my covenant be broken with
                            David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the
                            Levites the priests, my ministers.</p>
                        <p>22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I
                            multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</p>
                        <p>23 Moreover the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came to Jeremiah, saying,</p>
                        <p>24 Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my
                            people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</p>
                        <p>25 Thus saith the Lord; If my covenant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not
                            with day and
                            night,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>if</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have
                            not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</p>
                        <p>26 Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my
                            servant,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that I will not
                            take<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of his
                            seed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>rulers
                            over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and
                            have mercy on them.</p>

                        <p>THE word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all
                            his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought
                            against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell
                            him, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
                            Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</p>
                        <p>3 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into
                            his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak
                            with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</p>
                        <p>4 Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:</p>
                        <p>5<span>&nbsp;</span><em>But</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt die in peace: and with the
                            burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they
                            burn<span>&nbsp;</span><em>odours</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for thee; and they will lament
                            thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p>6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
                        </p>
                        <p>7 When the king of Babylon&rsquo;s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities
                            of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities
                            remained of the cities of Judah.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em>This</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant
                            with all the people which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at Jerusalem, to
                            proclaim liberty unto them;</p>
                        <p>9 That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
                            maidservant,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an Hebrew or an Hebrewess,
                            go free; that none should serve himself of
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>wit</em>, of a Jew his brother.
                        </p>
                        <p>10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard
                            that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none
                            should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and
                            let<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>go.</p>
                        <p>11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go
                            free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Therefore the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came
                            to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>13 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day
                            that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,</p>
                        <p>14 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold
                            unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but
                            your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.</p>
                        <p>15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man
                            to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my
                            name:</p>
                        <p>16 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his
                            handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into
                            subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.</p>
                        <p>17 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty,
                            every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for
                            you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you
                            to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
                        <p>18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the
                            words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and
                            passed between the parts thereof,</p>
                        <p>19 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all
                            the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;</p>
                        <p>20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek
                            their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the
                            beasts of the earth.</p>
                        <p>21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and
                            into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon&rsquo;s
                            army, which are gone up from you.</p>
                        <p>22 Behold, I will command, saith the Lord, and cause them to return to this city; and they
                            shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of
                            Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.</p>

                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>THE word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in the days of Jehoiakim
                            the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of
                            the Lord, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</p>
                        <p>3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all
                            his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;</p>
                        <p>4 And I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the
                            son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the
                            chamber of the princes, which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>above the
                            chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:</p>
                        <p>5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I
                            said unto them, Drink ye wine.</p>
                        <p>6 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded
                            us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neither</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye,
                            nor your sons for ever:</p>
                        <p>7 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor
                            have<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>but all your days ye shall dwell in
                            tents; that ye may live many days in the land where
                            ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>strangers.</p>
                        <p>8 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath
                            charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;</p>
                        <p>9 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:</p>
                        <p>10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our
                            father commanded us.</p>
                        <p>11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we
                            said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear
                            of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto Jeremiah,
                            saying,</p>
                        <p>13 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of
                            Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my
                            words? saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are
                            performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father&rsquo;s commandment:
                            notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto
                            me.</p>
                        <p>15 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and
                            sending<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way,
                            and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the
                            land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor
                            hearkened unto me.</p>
                        <p>16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their
                            father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:</p>
                        <p>17 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
                            will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have
                            pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I
                            have called unto them, but they have not answered.</p>
                        <p>18<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment
                            of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath
                            commanded you:</p>

                            the Lord, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee
                            against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto
                            thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.</p>
                        <p>3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them;
                            that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and
                            their sin.</p>
                        <p>4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah
                            all the words of the Lord, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.</p>
                        <p>5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying,
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shut up; I cannot go into the house of the
                            Lord:</p>
                        <p>6 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words
                            of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in the ears of the people in the Lord&rsquo;s house upon the
                            fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their
                            cities.</p>
                        <p>7 It may be they will present their supplication before the Lord, and will return every one
                            from his evil way: for great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the anger and
                            the fury that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath pronounced against this people.</p>
                        <p>8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him,
                            reading in the book the words of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in the Lord&rsquo;s house.</p>
                        <p>9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the
                            ninth month,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they proclaimed a fast before
                            the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came
                            from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord, in the
                            chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the
                            new gate of the Lord&rsquo;s house, in the ears of all the people.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard
                            out of the book all the words of the Lord,</p>
                        <p>12 Then he went down into the king&rsquo;s house, into the scribe&rsquo;s chamber: and, lo,
                            all the princes sat there,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Elishama the
                            scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the
                            son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</p>
                        <p>13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the
                            book in the ears of the people.</p>
                        <p>14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son
                            of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the
                            ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and
                            came unto them.</p>
                        <p>15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch
                            read<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in their ears.</p>
                        <p>16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and
                            other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</p>
                        <p>17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his
                            mouth?</p>
                        <p>18 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I
                            wrote<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with ink in the book.</p>
                        <p>19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know
                            where ye be.</p>
                        <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the
                            roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
                        </p>
                        <p>21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the
                            scribe&rsquo;s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all
                            the princes which stood beside the king.</p>
                        <p>22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month:
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>a</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>fire</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on
                            the hearth burning before him.</p>
                        <p>23 And it came to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when Jehudi had
                            read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and
                            cast<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into the fire
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the hearth, until all the roll was
                            consumed in the fire that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on the hearth.
                        </p>
                        <p>24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their
                            garments,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neither</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king, nor any of his
                            servants that heard all these words.</p>
                        <p>25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he
                            would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.</p>
                        <p>26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and
                            Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hid them.</p>
                        <p>27<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came to Jeremiah,
                            after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of
                            Jeremiah, saying,</p>
                        <p>28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first
                            roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.</p>
                        <p>29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast burned this
                            roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly
                            come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</p>
                        <p>30 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have
                            none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the
                            heat, and in the night to the frost.</p>
                        <p>31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring
                            upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil
                            that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</p>
                        <p>32<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe,
                            the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book
                            which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them
                            many like words.</p>

                        <p>AND king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom
                            Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</p>
                        <p>2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of
                            the Lord, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.</p>
                        <p>3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah
                            the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God
                            for us.</p>
                        <p>4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
                        </p>
                        <p>5 Then Pharaoh&rsquo;s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged
                            Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto the prophet
                            Jeremiah, saying,</p>
                        <p>7 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent
                            you unto me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh&rsquo;s army, which is come forth to help you,
                            shall return to Egypt into their own land.</p>
                        <p>8 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it
                            with fire.</p>
                        <p>9 Thus saith the Lord; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from
                            us: for they shall not depart.</p>
                        <p>10 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and
                            there remained<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wounded men among
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>should they rise up every man in his
                            tent, and burn this city with fire.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
                            broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh&rsquo;s army,</p>
                        <p>12 Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate
                            himself thence in the midst of the people.</p>
                        <p>13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the
                            ward<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>there, whose
                            name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son
                            of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
                        </p>
                        <p>14 Then said
                            Jeremiah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>false;
                            I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and
                            brought him to the princes.</p>
                        <p>15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in
                            the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</p>
                        <p>16<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,
                            and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</p>
                        <p>17 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his
                            house, and said, Is there<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>word from the
                            Lord? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of
                            the king of Babylon.</p>
                        <p>18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against
                            thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</p>
                        <p>19 Where<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>now your prophets which prophesied
                            unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</p>
                        <p>20 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be
                            accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
                            lest I die there.</p>
                        <p>21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the
                            prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers&rsquo;
                            street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of
                            the prison.</p>

                        <p>THEN Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of
                            Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all
                            the people, saying,</p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine,
                            and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall
                            have his life for a prey, and shall live.</p>
                        <p>3 Thus saith the Lord, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of
                            Babylon&rsquo;s army, which shall take it.</p>
                        <p>4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death:
                            for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of
                            all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of
                            this people, but the hurt.</p>
                        <p>5 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                            your hand: for the
                            king<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>can
                            do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thing against you.</p>
                        <p>6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the court of the prison: and they
                            let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the
                            dungeon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</p>
                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in
                            the king&rsquo;s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then
                            sitting in the gate of Benjamin;</p>
                        <p>8 Ebed-melech went forth out of the king&rsquo;s house, and spake to the king, saying,</p>
                        <p>9 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the
                            prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place
                            where he is:
                            for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no more
                            bread in the city.</p>
                        <p>10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with
                            thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</p>
                        <p>11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the
                            treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords
                            into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</p>
                        <p>12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put
                            now<span>&nbsp;</span><em>these</em><span>&nbsp;</span>old cast clouts and rotten rags under
                            thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</p>
                        <p>13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah
                            remained in the court of the prison.</p>
                        <p>14<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto
                            him into the third entry that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the house
                            of the Lord: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
                        </p>
                        <p>15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I
                            declare<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto thee, wilt thou not surely put
                            me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?</p>
                        <p>16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah,
                            saying,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth,
                            that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand
                            of these men that seek thy life.</p>
                        <p>17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of
                            Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes, then thy
                            soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine
                            house:</p>
                        <p>18 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes, then shall this city
                            be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt
                            not escape out of their hand.</p>
                        <p>19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the
                            Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</p>
                        <p>20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thee</em>. Obey, I beseech
                            thee, the voice of the Lord, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy
                            soul shall live.</p>
                        <p>21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            word that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath shewed me:</p>
                        <p>22 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah&rsquo;s
                            house<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brought
                            forth to the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes, and
                            those<span>&nbsp;</span><em>women</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall say, Thy friends have set
                            thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the
                            mire,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they are turned away back.</p>
                        <p>23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt
                            not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and
                            thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</p>
                        <p>24<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words,
                            and thou shalt not die.</p>
                        <p>25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say
                            unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and
                            we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:</p>
                        <p>26 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would
                            not cause me to return to Jonathan&rsquo;s house, to die there.</p>
                        <p>27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all
                            these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter
                            was not perceived.</p>
                        <p>28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and
                            he was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when Jerusalem was taken.</p>

                        <p class="center"></p>
                        <p>IN the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of
                            Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</p>
                        <p>2<span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the
                            fourth month, the ninth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the month, the
                            city was broken up.</p>
                        <p>3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle
                            gate,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo,
                            Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the
                            king of Babylon.</p>
                        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it came to
                            pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
                            them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by
                            the way of the king&rsquo;s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the
                            way of the plain.</p>
                        <p>5 But the Chaldeans&rsquo; army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of
                            Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
                            to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.</p>
                        <p>6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king
                            of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</p>
                        <p>7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah&rsquo;s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to
                            Babylon.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the Chaldeans burned the king&rsquo;s house, and the houses of
                            the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>9 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of
                            the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the
                            rest of the people that remained.</p>
                        <p>10 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had
                            nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah
                            to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,</p>
                        <p>12 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say
                            unto thee.</p>
                        <p>13 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and
                            Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes;</p>
                        <p>14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto
                            Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt
                            among the people.</p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>came unto Jeremiah,
                            while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</p>
                        <p>16 Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this
                            city for evil, and not for good; and they shall
                            be<span>&nbsp;</span><em>accomplished</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in that day before thee.</p>
                        <p>17 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord: and thou shalt not be given into the
                            hand of the men of whom thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>afraid.</p>
                        <p>18 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall
                            be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.</p>

                        <p>THE word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the
                            guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that
                            were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto
                            Babylon.</p>
                        <p>2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.</p>
                        <p>3 Now the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath brought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and done
                            according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the Lord, and have not obeyed his
                            voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.</p>
                        <p>4 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon thine hand. If it seem good
                            unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem
                            ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the
                            land<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before thee: whither it seemeth good
                            and convenient for thee to go, thither go.</p>
                        <p>5 Now while he was not yet gone
                            back,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>he</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>said</em>, Go back also to
                            Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor
                            over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth
                            convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and
                            let him go.</p>
                        <p>6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the
                            people that were left in the land.</p>
                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now when all the captains of the forces
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                            fields,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they and their men, heard that the
                            king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed
                            unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not
                            carried away captive to Babylon;</p>
                        <p>8 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and
                            Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the
                            Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</p>
                        <p>9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying,
                            Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it
                            shall be well with you.</p>
                        <p>10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us:
                            but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and
                            put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in your vessels, and dwell in your
                            cities that ye have taken.</p>
                        <p>11 Likewise when all the Jews that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Moab,
                            and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all the countries, heard that the
                            king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son
                            of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;</p>
                        <p>12 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the
                            land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</p>
                        <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
                            forces that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the fields, came to
                            Gedaliah to Mizpah,</p>
                        <p>14 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath
                            sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them
                            not.</p>
                        <p>15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I
                            pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall
                            know<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wherefore should he slay thee, that
                            all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah
                            perish?</p>
                        <p>16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this
                            thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.</p>

                        <p>NOW it came to pass in the seventh
                            month,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the
                            son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came
                            unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
                        </p>
                        <p>2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote
                            Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of
                            Babylon had made governor over the land.</p>
                        <p>3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with
                            him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the
                            Chaldeans that were found there,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the men of
                            war.</p>
                        <p>4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man
                            knew<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>,</p>
                        <p>5 That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from
                            Samaria,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fourscore men, having their
                            beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense
                            in their hand, to bring<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the house of
                            the Lord.</p>
                        <p>6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as
                            he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of
                            Ahikam.</p>
                        <p>7 And it was<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em>, when they came into the midst of the city, that
                            Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>cast</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into
                            the midst of the pit, he, and the men
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him.</p>
                        <p>8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have
                            treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare,
                            and slew them not among their brethren.</p>
                        <p>9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain
                            because of Gedaliah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it which Asa the king
                            had made for fear of Baasha king of
                            Israel:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled
                            it
                            with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>slain.
                        </p>
                        <p>10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                            Mizpah,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the king&rsquo;s daughters, and
                            all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had
                            committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away
                            captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
                            forces that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, heard of all the
                            evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</p>
                        <p>12 Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found
                            him by the great waters that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in Gibeon.</p>
                        <p>13 Now it came to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when all the people
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of
                            Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, then they were glad.</p>
                        <p>14 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and
                            returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.</p>
                        <p>15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the
                            Ammonites.</p>
                        <p>16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him, all the remnant of the
                            people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah,
                            after<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he had slain Gedaliah the son of
                            Ahikam,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em>mighty men of war, and the women, and the children,
                            and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:</p>
                        <p>17 And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go
                            to enter into Egypt,</p>
                        <p>18 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of
                            Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in
                            the land.</p>

                        <p>THEN all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of
                            Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,</p>
                        <p>2 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted
                            before thee, and pray for us unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>thy

                        <p>10 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not

                        <p>11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith

                            deliver you from his hand.</p>
                        <p>12 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return
                            to your own land.</p>
                        <p>13<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the

                        <p>14 Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the
                            sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:</p>
                        <p>15 And now therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter
                            into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</p>
                        <p>16 Then it shall come to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the sword,
                            which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye
                            were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.</p>
                        <p>17 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there;
                            they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall
                            remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.</p>
                        <p>18 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and
                            my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured
                            forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an
                            astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.</p>
                        <p>19<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath said concerning you, O ye remnant
                            of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.</p>
                        <p>20 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>your
                            God, saying, Pray for us unto the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God; and according unto all
                            that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will
                            do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                        <p>21 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>now</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I have this day
                            declared<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to you; but ye have not obeyed the

                        <p>22 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the
                            pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to

                        <p>AND it came to pass,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when Jeremiah had made
                            an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their
                            God, for which the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God had sent him to
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all these words,</p>
                        <p>2 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud
                            men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God hath
                            not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:</p>
                        <p>3 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of
                            the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</p>
                        <p>4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people,
                            obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Judah.</p>
                        <p>5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of
                            Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the
                            land of Judah;</p>
                        <p>6<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>men, and women, and children, and the
                            king&rsquo;s daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left
                            with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the
                            son of Neriah.</p>
                        <p>7 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: thus came
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to Tahpanhes.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then came the word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>unto Jeremiah in
                            Tahpanhes, saying,</p>
                        <p>9 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>at the entry of Pharaoh&rsquo;s house
                            in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;</p>
                        <p>10 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel;
                            Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set
                            his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over
                            them.</p>
                        <p>11 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of
                            Egypt,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>deliver</em><span>&nbsp;</span>such<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>for

                            sword to the sword.</p>
                        <p>12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and
                            carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd
                            putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</p>
                        <p>13 He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of Egypt; and the houses of
                            the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.</p>

                        <p>THE word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt,
                            which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
                        </p>
                        <p>2 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the
                            evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this
                            day they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a desolation, and no man dwelleth
                            therein,</p>
                        <p>3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they
                            went to burn incense,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to serve other gods,
                            whom they knew not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>neither</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they, ye, nor your
                            fathers.</p>
                        <p>4 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and
                            sending<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em>, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I
                            hate.</p>
                        <p>5 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no
                            incense unto other gods.</p>
                        <p>6 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah
                            and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are
                            wasted<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>desolate, as at this day.</p>
                        <p>7 Therefore now thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit
                            ye<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>great evil against your souls, to cut
                            off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;
                        </p>
                        <p>8 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other
                            gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off,
                            and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</p>
                        <p>9 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah,
                            and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your
                            wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</p>
                        <p>10 They are not humbled<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto this day,
                            neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you
                            and before your fathers.</p>
                        <p>11<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God
                            of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</p>
                        <p>12 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of
                            Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be
                            consumed,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fall in the land of Egypt; they
                            shall<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>be consumed by the
                            sword<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the famine: they shall die, from
                            the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an
                            execration,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an astonishment, and a curse,
                            and a reproach.</p>
                        <p>13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by
                            the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:</p>
                        <p>14 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn
                            there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which
                            they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
                        </p>
                        <p>15<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense
                            unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people
                            that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</p>
                        <p>16<span>&nbsp;</span><em>As</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the word
                            that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</p>
                        <p>17 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn
                            incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done,
                            we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets
                            of Jerusalem: for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>had we plenty of
                            victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.</p>
                        <p>18 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink
                            offerings unto her, we have wanted all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em>, and have been
                            consumed by the sword and by the famine.</p>
                        <p>19 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto
                            her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without
                            our men?</p>
                        <p>20<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the
                            women, and to all the people which had given
                            him<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>answer, saying,</p>
                        <p>21 The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye,
                            and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>remember them, and came
                            it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into his mind?</p>
                        <p>22 So that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>could no longer bear, because of the evil of your
                            doings,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>because of the abominations which
                            ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse,
                            without an inhabitant, as at this day.</p>
                        <p>23 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the Lord, and have not
                            obeyed the voice of the Lord, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his
                            testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</p>
                        <p>24 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the
                            Lord, all Judah that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of Egypt:
                        </p>
                        <p>25 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your
                            wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will
                            surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to
                            pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform
                            your vows.</p>
                        <p>26 Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold,
                            I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, that my name shall no more be named in the
                            mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord
                            God<span>&nbsp;</span>liveth.</p>
                        <p>27 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land of Egypt shall be consumed
                            by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</p>
                        <p>28 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the
                            land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn
                            there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</p>
                        <p>29<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And
                            this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a sign
                            unto you, saith the Lord, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my
                            words shall surely stand against you for evil:</p>
                        <p>30 Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his
                            enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into
                            the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</p>

                        <p>3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath added grief to my
                            sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.</p>
                        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus shalt thou say unto him, The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>saith
                            thus; Behold,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which I have built will I
                            break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.</p>
                        <p>5 And seekest thou great things for thyself?
                            seek<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not: for, behold, I will bring evil
                            upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places
                            whither thou goest.</p>

                        <p>THE word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the

                        <p>2 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river
                            Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of
                            Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.</p>
                        <p>3 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.</p>
                        <p>4 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth
                            with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>helmets; furbish the
                            spears,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>put on the brigandines.</p>
                        <p>5 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>turned
                            away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not

                        <p>6 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward
                            the north by the river Euphrates.</p>
                        <p>7 Who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cometh

                        <p>8 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>waters
                            are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go
                            up,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>will cover the earth; I will destroy

                        <p>9 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the
                            Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that
                            handle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bend the bow.</p>

                            blood: for the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by

                            hath stumbled against the mighty,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they are

                        <p>14 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye,
                            Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.</p>
                        <p>15 Why are thy valiant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em><span>&nbsp;</span>swept away? they
                            stood not, because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>did drive them.</p>
                        <p>16 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go
                            again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.</p>
                        <p>17 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of

                            cometh out of the north.</p>
                        <p>21 Also her hired men<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst of her
                            like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned
                            back,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are fled away together: they did not
                            stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon
                            them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the time of their visitation.</p>
                        <p>22 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come
                            against her with axes, as hewers of wood.</p>
                        <p>23 They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord, though it cannot be searched; because they
                            are more than the grasshoppers,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>innumerable.</p>
                        <p>24 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the
                            people of the north.</p>
                        <p>25 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the
                            multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>all</em><span>&nbsp;</span>them that trust in him:</p>
                        <p>26 And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of
                            Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be
                            inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>27<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
                            Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their
                            captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall
                            make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>afraid.</p>
                        <p>28 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the Lord: for
                            I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with thee; for I will make a full end of
                            all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but
                            correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.</p>

                            name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.
                        </p>
                        <p>16 The calamity of Moab<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>near to come, and his
                            affliction hasteth fast.</p>
                        <p>17 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the
                            strong staff broken,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the beautiful rod!</p>
                        <p>18 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down
                            from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>thy</em><span>&nbsp;</span>glory, and sit in thirst; for the
                            spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he
                            shall destroy thy strong holds.</p>
                        <p>19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that
                            escapeth,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>say, What is done?</p>
                        <p>20 Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is
                            spoiled,</p>
                        <p>21 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon
                            Mephaath,</p>
                        <p>22 And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,</p>
                        <p>23 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,</p>
                        <p>24 And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or
                            near.</p>
                        <p>25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>26<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make ye him drunken: for he
                            magnified<span>&nbsp;</span><em>himself</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against the Lord: Moab also
                            shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</p>
                        <p>27 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou
                            spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.</p>
                        <p>28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the
                            dove<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>maketh her nest in the sides of the
                            hole&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
                        <p>29 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy,
                            and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.</p>
                        <p>30 I know his wrath, saith the Lord;
                            but<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>so;
                            his lies shall not so effect<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                        <p>31 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all
                            Moab;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>mine</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>heart</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall
                            mourn for the men of Kir-heres.</p>
                        <p>32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over
                            the sea, they reach<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the sea of Jazer:
                            the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.</p>
                        <p>33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I
                            have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with
                            shouting;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shouting<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            shouting.</p>
                        <p>34 From the cry of Heshbon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                            Elealeh,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                            Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from
                            Zoar<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto
                            Horonaim,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>as</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an heifer of three years old: for
                            the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</p>
                        <p>35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high
                            places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</p>
                        <p>36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like
                            pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the
                            riches<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he hath gotten are perished.</p>
                        <p>37 For every
                            head<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bald,
                            and every beard clipped: upon all the
                            hands<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cuttings,
                            and upon the loins sackcloth.</p>
                        <p>38<span>&nbsp;</span><em>There</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lamentation
                            generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab
                            like a vessel wherein<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no pleasure, saith the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p>39 They shall howl,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
                            turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about
                            him.</p>
                        <p>40 For thus saith the Lord; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over
                            Moab.</p>
                        <p>41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men&rsquo;s hearts in
                            Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>
                        <p>42 And Moab shall be destroyed from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>being</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            people, because he hath
                            magnified<span>&nbsp;</span><em>himself</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against the Lord.</p>
                        <p>43 Fear, and the pit, and the
                            snare,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon
                            thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>44 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the
                            pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon
                            it,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon Moab, the year of their
                            visitation, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>45 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall
                            come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner
                            of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</p>
                        <p>46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken
                            captives, and thy daughters captives.</p>
                        <p>47<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days,
                            saith the Lord. Thus far<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the judgment of
                            Moab.</p>

                        <p>CONCERNING the Ammonites, thus saith the Lord; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir?
                            why<span>&nbsp;</span><em>then</em><span>&nbsp;</span>doth their king inherit Gad, and his
                            people dwell in his cities?</p>
                        <p>2 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will cause an alarm of war to be
                            heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall
                            be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the
                            Lord.</p>
                        <p>3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth;
                            lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into
                            captivity,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his priests and his princes
                            together.</p>
                        <p>4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that
                            trusted in her treasures,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Who shall come unto me?</p>
                        <p>5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, from
                            all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none
                            shall gather up him that wandereth.</p>
                        <p>6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the Lord.

                        <p>7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Concerning Edom, thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of
                            hosts;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel
                            perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</p>
                        <p>8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of
                            Esau upon him, the time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will visit him.
                        </p>
                        <p>9 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not
                            leave<span>&nbsp;</span><em>some</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gleaning grapes? if thieves by
                            night, they will destroy till they have enough.</p>
                        <p>10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to
                            hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and
                            he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not.</p>
                        <p>11 Leave thy fatherless children, I will
                            preserve<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>alive; and let thy widows trust
                            in me.</p>
                        <p>12 For thus saith the Lord; Behold, they whose
                            judgment<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not to drink of the cup have
                            assuredly drunken; and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou
                            he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall altogether go unpunished? thou
                            shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely
                            drink<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>.</p>
                        <p>13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a
                            reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</p>
                        <p>14 I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent unto the
                            heathen,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Gather ye together, and come against her, and
                            rise up to the battle.</p>
                        <p>15 For, lo, I will make thee small among the
                            heathen,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>despised among men.</p>
                        <p>16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the
                            height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring
                            thee down from thence, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>17 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall
                            hiss at all the plagues thereof.</p>
                        <p>18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the
                            neighbour<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cities</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thereof, saith the Lord, no
                            man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</p>
                        <p>19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of
                            the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and
                            who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            chosen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                            may appoint over her? for who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like me? and
                            who will appoint me the time? and who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                            shepherd that will stand before me?</p>
                        <p>20 Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes,
                            that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall
                            draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</p>
                        <p>21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in
                            the Red sea.</p>
                        <p>22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at
                            that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

                        <p>24 Damascus is waxed feeble,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>turneth herself
                            to flee, and fear hath seized on<span>&nbsp;</span><em>her:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>anguish
                            and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</p>
                        <p>25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</p>
                        <p>26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off
                            in that day, saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                        <p>27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of
                            Ben-hadad.</p>
                        <p>28<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
                            Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the Lord; Arise ye, go up to Kedar,
                            and spoil the men of the east.</p>
                        <p>29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their
                            curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them,
                            Fear<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>on every side.</p>
                        <p>30<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
                            saith the Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath
                            conceived a purpose against you.</p>
                        <p>31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the Lord,
                            which have neither gates nor bars,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dwell
                            alone.</p>
                        <p>32 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will
                            scatter into all winds
                            them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                            utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for
                            dragons,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a desolation for ever: there shall
                            no man abide there, nor<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>son of man dwell in
                            it.</p>
                        <p>34<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>that came to Jeremiah the
                            prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</p>
                        <p>35 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the
                            chief of their might.</p>
                        <p>36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will
                            scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of
                            Elam shall not come.</p>
                        <p>37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their
                            life: and I will bring evil upon them,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my
                            fierce anger, saith the Lord; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed
                            them:</p>
                        <p>38 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes,
                            saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>39<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But it shall come to pass in the latter
                            days,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will bring again the captivity of
                            Elam, saith the Lord.</p>

                        <p>THE word that the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>spake against
                            Babylon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against the land of the Chaldeans
                            by Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
                        <p>2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;
                            publish,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>conceal not: say, Babylon is
                            taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images
                            are broken in pieces.</p>
                        <p>3 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land
                            desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and
                            beast.</p>
                        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of
                            Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall
                            go, and seek the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>their God.</p>
                        <p>5 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces
                            thitherward,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Come, and let us join ourselves to the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>in a perpetual
                            covenant<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall not be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>6 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have
                            turned them away<span>&nbsp;</span><em>on</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the mountains: they have
                            gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</p>
                        <p>7 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because
                            they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of justice, even the Lord, the hope of
                            their fathers.</p>
                        <p>8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be
                            as the he goats before the flocks.</p>
                        <p>9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
                            assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array
                            against her; from thence she shall be taken: their
                            arrows<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as
                            of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.</p>
                        <p>10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye
                            are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;</p>
                        <p>12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the
                            hindermost of the
                            nations<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</p>
                        <p>13 Because of the wrath of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>it shall not be inhabited, but it shall
                            be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her
                            plagues.</p>
                        <p>14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at
                            her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the Lord.</p>
                        <p>15 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her
                            walls are thrown down: for it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the vengeance
                            of the Lord: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.</p>
                        <p>16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest:
                            for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall
                            flee every one to his own land.</p>
                        <p>17<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a scattered
                            sheep; the lions have driven<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>away: first
                            the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath
                            broken his bones.</p>
                        <p>18 Therefore thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
                            will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</p>
                        <p>19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan,
                            and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.</p>
                        <p>20 In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought
                            for,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>none;
                            and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
                        </p>
                        <p>21<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Go up against the land of
                            Merathaim,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against it, and against the
                            inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the Lord, and do according
                            to all that I have commanded thee.</p>
                        <p>22 A sound of battle<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the land, and of
                            great destruction.</p>
                        <p>23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a
                            desolation among the nations!</p>
                        <p>24 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware:
                            thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord.</p>
                        <p>25 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of
                            his indignation: for this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the work of the
                            Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</p>
                        <p>26 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and
                            destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</p>
                        <p>27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is
                            come, the time of their visitation.</p>
                        <p>28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the
                            vengeance of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God, the vengeance of his temple.</p>
                        <p>29 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round
                            about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that
                            she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the Lord, against the Holy One
                            of Israel.</p>
                        <p>30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off
                            in that day, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>31 Behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against
                            thee,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>O</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>thou</em><span>&nbsp;</span>most
                            proud, saith the Lord God<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts: for thy day is come, the
                            time<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I will visit thee.</p>
                        <p>32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle
                            a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</p>
                        <p>33<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; The children of
                            Israel and the children of Judah<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>oppressed
                            together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.</p>
                        <p>34 Their Redeemer<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>strong; the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name: he
                            shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the
                            inhabitants of Babylon.</p>
                        <p>35<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A sword<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the
                            Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and
                            upon her wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>.</p>
                        <p>36 A sword<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon the liars; and they shall
                            dote: a sword<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon her mighty men; and they
                            shall be dismayed.</p>
                        <p>37 A sword<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon their horses, and upon their
                            chariots, and upon all the mingled people
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the midst of her; and they shall
                            become as women: a sword<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon her treasures;
                            and they shall be robbed.</p>
                        <p>38 A drought<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon her waters; and they shall
                            be dried up: for it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the land of graven
                            images, and they are mad upon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>idols.</p>
                        <p>39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall
                            dwell<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em>, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no
                            more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</p>
                        <p>40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the
                            neighbour<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cities</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thereof, saith the
                            Lord;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>shall no man abide there, neither
                            shall any son of man dwell therein.</p>
                        <p>41 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be
                            raised up from the coasts of the earth.</p>
                        <p>42 They shall hold the bow and the lance:
                            they<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>cruel, and will not shew mercy: their
                            voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon
                            horses,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>every</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>put
                            in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</p>
                        <p>43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish
                            took hold of him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>pangs as of a woman in
                            travail.</p>
                        <p>44 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of
                            the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and
                            who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            chosen<span>&nbsp;</span><em>man</em>,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>I
                            may appoint over her? for who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like me? and
                            who will appoint me the time? and who<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                            shepherd that will stand before me?</p>
                        <p>45 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his
                            purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the
                            flock shall draw them out: surely he shall
                            make<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>habitation desolate with them.</p>
                        <p>46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the
                            nations.</p>

                        <p>THUS saith the Lord; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in
                            the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;</p>
                        <p>2 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in
                            the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.</p>
                        <p>3 Against<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bendeth
                            let the archer bend his bow, and
                            against<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>lifteth
                            himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her
                            host.</p>
                        <p>4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thrust
                            through in her streets.</p>
                        <p>5 For
                            Israel<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not<span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forsaken,
                            nor Judah of his God, of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; though their land was filled
                            with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
                        <p>6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her
                            iniquity; for this<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the time of the
                            Lord&rsquo;s vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.</p>
                        <p>7 Babylon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>been</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            golden cup in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have
                            drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.</p>
                        <p>8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be
                            she may be healed.</p>
                        <p>9 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one
                            into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted
                            up<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the skies.</p>
                        <p>10 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare
                            in Zion the work of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>our God.</p>
                        <p>11 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath raised up the
                            spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his
                            device<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against Babylon, to destroy it;
                            because it<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the vengeance of the Lord, the
                            vengeance of his temple.</p>
                        <p>12 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen,
                            prepare the ambushes: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath both devised and done that which
                            he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>
                        <p>13 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is
                            come,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the measure of thy covetousness.</p>
                        <p>14 The Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts hath sworn by
                            himself,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>saying</em>, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with
                            caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.</p>
                        <p>15 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath
                            stretched out the heaven by his understanding.</p>
                        <p>16 When he
                            uttereth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>voice,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of
                            the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
                        </p>
                        <p>17 Every man is brutish by<span>&nbsp;</span><em>his</em><span>&nbsp;</span>knowledge; every
                            founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten
                            image<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>falsehood,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>there</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>no
                            breath in them.</p>
                        <p>18 They<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vanity, the work of errors: in the
                            time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>
                        <p>19 The portion of Jacob<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not like them; for
                            he<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the former of all things:
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Israel</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            rod of his inheritance: the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of
                            hosts<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his name.</p>
                        <p>20 Thou<span>&nbsp;</span><em>art</em><span>&nbsp;</span>my battle
                            axe<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>weapons of war: for with thee will I
                            break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;</p>
                        <p>21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break
                            in pieces the chariot and his rider;</p>
                        <p>22 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces
                            old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;</p>
                        <p>23 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I
                            break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces
                            captains and rulers.</p>
                        <p>24 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that
                            they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>25 Behold, I<span>&nbsp;</span><em>am</em><span>&nbsp;</span>against thee, O destroying
                            mountain, saith the Lord, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand
                            upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.</p>
                        <p>26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but
                            thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>27 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations
                            against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint
                            a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.</p>
                        <p>28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all
                            the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.</p>
                        <p>29 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a
                            desolation without an inhabitant.</p>
                        <p>30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained
                            in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>their</em><span>&nbsp;</span>holds: their might hath failed; they
                            became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.</p>
                        <p>31 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of
                            Babylon that his city is taken at<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>end,</p>
                        <p>32 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men
                            of war are affrighted.</p>
                        <p>33 For thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of
                            Babylon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like a
                            threshingfloor,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>time
                            to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</p>
                        <p>34 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me
                            an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my
                            delicates, he hath cast me out.</p>
                        <p>35 The violence done to me and to my
                            flesh<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of
                            Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.</p>
                        <p>36 Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for
                            thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.</p>
                        <p>37 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an
                            hissing, without an inhabitant.</p>
                        <p>38 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions&rsquo; whelps.</p>
                        <p>39 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may
                            rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.</p>
                        <p>41 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon
                            become an astonishment among the nations!</p>
                        <p>42 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
                        </p>
                        <p>43 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth,
                            neither doth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>any</em><span>&nbsp;</span>son of man pass thereby.</p>
                        <p>44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he
                            hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall
                            of Babylon shall fall.</p>
                        <p>45 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the
                            fierce anger of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>46 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a
                            rumour shall both come<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>year, and after that
                            in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>another</em><span>&nbsp;</span>year<span>&nbsp;</span><em>shall</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>come</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</p>
                        <p>47 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of
                            Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst
                            of her.</p>
                        <p>48 Then the heaven and the earth, and all
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>therein, shall sing for Babylon: for
                            the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>49 As
                            Babylon<span>&nbsp;</span><em>hath</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>caused</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</p>
                        <p>50 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</p>
                        <p>51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for
                            strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the Lord&rsquo;s house.</p>
                        <p>52 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will do judgment upon her graven
                            images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</p>
                        <p>53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her
                            strength,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from me shall spoilers come unto
                            her, saith the Lord.</p>
                        <p>54 A sound of a cry<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cometh</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from Babylon, and
                            great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:</p>
                        <p>55 Because the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the
                            great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:
                        </p>
                        <p>56 Because the spoiler is come upon
                            her,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon Babylon, and her mighty men are
                            taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>God of recompences
                            shall surely requite.</p>
                        <p>57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, her
                            captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and
                            not wake, saith the King, whose name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the
                            Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts.</p>
                        <p>58 Thus saith the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be
                            utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in
                            vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.</p>
                        <p>59<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of
                            Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in
                            the fourth year of his reign.
                            And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Seraiah<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a
                            quiet prince.</p>
                        <p>60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
                            Babylon,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all these words that are written
                            against Babylon.</p>
                        <p>61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read
                            all these words;</p>
                        <p>62 Then shalt thou say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none
                            shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.</p>
                        <p>63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
                            book,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thou shalt bind a stone to it, and
                            cast it into the midst of Euphrates:</p>
                        <p>64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will
                            bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus
                            far<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the words of Jeremiah.</p>

                        <p>ZEDEKIAH<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>one and twenty years old when he
                            began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s
                            name<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of
                            Libnah.</p>
                        <p>2 And he
                            did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>evil
                            in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</p>
                        <p>3 For through the anger of the Lord<span>&nbsp;</span>it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah,
                            till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of
                            Babylon.</p>
                        <p>4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
                            month, in the tenth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                            month,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
                            came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts
                            against it round about.</p>
                        <p>5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</p>
                        <p>6 And in the fourth month, in the ninth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                            the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the
                            land.</p>
                        <p>7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by
                            night by the way of the gate between the two walls,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the king&rsquo;s garden; (now the
                            Chaldeans<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>by the city round about:) and
                            they went by the way of the plain.</p>
                        <p>8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
                            Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</p>
                        <p>9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land
                            of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.</p>
                        <p>10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the
                            princes of Judah in Riblah.</p>
                        <p>11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and
                            carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</p>
                        <p>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now in the fifth month, in the
                            tenth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the month,
                            which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar
                            king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the
                            guard,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span>served the king of Babylon, into
                            Jerusalem,</p>
                        <p>13 And burned the house of the Lord, and the king&rsquo;s house; and all the houses of
                            Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, burned he with
                            fire:</p>
                        <p>14 And all the army of the Chaldeans,
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with the captain of the guard, brake
                            down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
                        <p>15 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away
                            captive<span>&nbsp;</span><em>certain</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the poor of the people, and
                            the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to
                            the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</p>
                        <p>16 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard
                            left<span>&nbsp;</span><em>certain</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the poor of the land for
                            vinedressers and for husbandmen.</p>
                        <p>17 Also the pillars of brass that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the
                            house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brasen sea
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in the house of the Lord, the
                            Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
                        <p>18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and
                            all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</p>
                        <p>19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks,
                            and the spoons, and the
                            cups;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                            gold<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>gold,
                            and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of
                            silver<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in</em><span>&nbsp;</span>silver, took the captain of the guard
                            away.</p>
                        <p>20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>under the bases, which king Solomon
                            had made in the house of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</p>
                        <p>21 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>concerning</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the pillars, the height of one
                            pillar<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>eighteen cubits; and a fillet of
                            twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness
                            thereof<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>four
                            fingers:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>hollow.
                        </p>
                        <p>22 And a chapiter of brass<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>upon it; and the
                            height of one chapiter<span>&nbsp;</span><em>was</em><span>&nbsp;</span>five cubits, with
                            network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about,
                            all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brass. The second pillar also and the
                            pomegranates<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>like unto these.</p>
                        <p>23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a
                            side;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the pomegranates upon the
                            network<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>an hundred round about.</p>
                        <p>24<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
                            Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
                        <p>25 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven
                            men of them that were near the king&rsquo;s person, which were found in the city; and the
                            principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the
                            people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</p>
                        <p>26 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of
                            Babylon to Riblah.</p>
                        <p>27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath.
                            Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.</p>
                        <p>28 This<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the people whom Nebuchadrezzar
                            carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</p>
                        <p>29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight
                            hundred thirty and two persons:</p>
                        <p>30 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard
                            carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the
                            persons<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>four thousand and six hundred.</p>
                        <p>31<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
                            captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and
                            twentieth<span>&nbsp;</span><em>day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of the
                            month,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Evil-merodach king of Babylon in
                            the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>first</em><span>&nbsp;</span>year of his reign lifted up the head
                            of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,</p>
                        <p>32 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings
                            that<span>&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with him in Babylon,</p>
                        <p>33 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days
                            of his life.</p>
                        <p>34 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>his diet, there was a continual diet
                            given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the
                            days of his life.</p>
