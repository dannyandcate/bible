                    <p>PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
                        Timotheus<span>&nbsp;</span><em>our</em><span>&nbsp;</span>brother,</p>
                    <p>2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse:
                        Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto you, and peace, from God our Father
                        and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</p>
                    <p>4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the
                        love<span>&nbsp;</span><em>which</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>ye</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>have</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to
                        all the saints,</p>
                    <p>5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the
                        truth of the gospel;</p>
                    <p>6 Which is come unto you,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in all the
                        world; and bringeth forth fruit,
                        as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>doth</em><span>&nbsp;</span>also in you,
                        since the day ye heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>of</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, and knew the
                        grace of God in truth:</p>
                    <p>7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of
                        Christ;</p>
                    <p>8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</p>
                    <p>9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em>, do not cease to
                        pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
                        and spiritual understanding;</p>
                    <p>10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work,
                        and increasing in the knowledge of God;</p>
                    <p>11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and
                        longsuffering with joyfulness;</p>
                    <p>12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of
                        the saints in light:</p>
                    <p>13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
                        translated<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>into the kingdom of his dear Son:</p>
                    <p>14 In whom we have redemption through his
                        blood,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the forgiveness of sins:</p>
                    <p>15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</p>
                    <p>16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
                        invisible,
                        whether<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>thrones,
                        or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</p>
                    <p>17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</p>
                    <p>18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead;
                        that in all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>things</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he might have the preeminence.
                    </p>
                    <p>19 For it
                        pleased<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Father</em><span>&nbsp;</span>that
                        in him should all fulness dwell;</p>
                    <p>20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto
                        himself; by him,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>say</em>,
                        whether<span>&nbsp;</span><em>they</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>things
                        in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
                    <p>21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies
                        in<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>mind by wicked works, yet now hath he
                        reconciled</p>
                    <p>22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable
                        in his sight:</p>
                    <p>23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>not moved away from the hope of the gospel,
                        which ye have heard,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>which was preached to
                        every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</p>
                    <p>24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions
                        of Christ in my flesh for his body&rsquo;s sake, which is the church:</p>
                    <p>25 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for
                        you, to fulfil the word of God;</p>
                    <p>26<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the mystery which hath been hid from ages
                        and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</p>
                    <p>27 To whom God would make known what<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the riches
                        of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</p>
                    <p>28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present
                        every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</p>
                    <p>29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</p>

                    <p>FOR I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>them at Laodicea,
                        and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>for</em><span>&nbsp;</span>as many as have not seen my face in the
                        flesh;</p>
                    <p>2 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the
                        full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the
                        Father, and of Christ;</p>
                    <p>3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
                    <p>4 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</p>
                    <p>5 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your
                        order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</p>
                    <p>6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the
                        Lord,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>so</em><span>&nbsp;</span>walk ye in him:</p>
                    <p>7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding
                        therein with thanksgiving.</p>
                    <p>8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
                        after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</p>
                    <p>9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</p>
                    <p>10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:</p>
                    <p>11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the
                        body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</p>
                    <p>12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em><span>&nbsp;</span>through the faith of the operation of God,
                        who hath raised him from the dead.</p>
                    <p>13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened
                        together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</p>
                    <p>14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and
                        took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</p>
                    <p>15<span>&nbsp;</span><em>And</em><span>&nbsp;</span>having spoiled principalities and powers, he
                        made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p>
                    <p>16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the
                        new moon, or of the sabbath<span>&nbsp;</span><em>days:</em></p>
                    <p>17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the
                        body<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of Christ.</p>
                    <p>18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,
                        intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</p>
                    <p>19 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment
                        ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</p>
                    <p>20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in
                        the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</p>
                    <p>21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;</p>
                    <p>22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</p>
                    <p>23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the
                        body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</p>

                    <p>2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</p>
                    <p>3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
                    <p>4 When Christ,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>who</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>our

                    <p>5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
                        affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</p>
                    <p>6 For which things&rsquo; sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</p>

                        your mouth.</p>
                    <p>9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</p>

                    <p>11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian,
                        bond<span>&nbsp;</span><em>nor</em><span>&nbsp;</span>free: but
                        Christ<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all, and in all.</p>
                    <p>12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness,
                        humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</p>
                    <p>13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even
                        as Christ forgave you, so also<span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>ye.</p>
                    <p>14 And above all these
                        things<span>&nbsp;</span><em>put</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>on</em><span>&nbsp;</span>charity,
                        which is the bond of perfectness.</p>
                    <p>15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and
                        be ye thankful.</p>
                    <p>16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another

                        according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing
                        God:</p>
                    <p>23 And whatsoever ye do, do<span>&nbsp;</span><em>it</em><span>&nbsp;</span>heartily, as to the
                        Lord, and not unto men;</p>
                    <p>24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord

                    <p>MASTERS, give unto<span>&nbsp;</span><em>your</em><span>&nbsp;</span>servants that which is just
                        and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.</p>
                    <p>2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</p>
                    <p>3 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the
                        mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</p>
                    <p>4 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</p>
                    <p>5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</p>
                    <p>6 Let your speech<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>alway with grace, seasoned with
                        salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.</p>
                    <p>7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto
                        you,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>who</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a beloved
                        brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:</p>
                    <p>8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort
                        your hearts;</p>
                    <p>9 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who
                        is<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of you. They shall make known unto you all
                        things
                        which<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>done</em><span>&nbsp;</span>here.</p>
                    <p>10 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister&rsquo;s son to Barnabas,
                        (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)</p>
                    <p>11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These
                        only<span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>fellowworkers
                        unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.</p>
                    <p>12 Epaphras, who is<span>&nbsp;</span><em>one</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of you, a servant of Christ,
                        saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and
                        complete in all the will of God.</p>
                    <p>13 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and
                        them<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>are</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in
                        Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</p>
                    <p>14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</p>
                    <p>15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.
                    </p>
                    <p>16 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the
                        Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read
                        the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>epistle</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from Laodicea.</p>
                    <p>17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that
                        thou fulfil it.</p>
                    <p>18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds.
                        Grace<span>&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with you. Amen.</p>
