                    <p>PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in
                        Christ Jesus,</p>
                    <p>2 To Timothy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>dearly beloved son: Grace,
                        mercy,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>peace, from God the Father and Christ
                        Jesus our Lord.</p>
                    <p>3 I thank God, whom I serve from<span>&nbsp;</span><em>my</em><span>&nbsp;</span>forefathers with
                        pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
                    </p>
                    <p>4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
                    <p>5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy
                        grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
                    <p>6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the
                        putting on of my hands.</p>
                    <p>7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou
                        partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
                    <p>9 Who hath saved us, and called<span>&nbsp;</span><em>us</em><span>&nbsp;</span>with an holy
                        calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given
                        us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>
                    <p>10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished
                        death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>
                    <p>11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
                    <p>12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom
                        I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
                        against that day.</p>
                    <p>13 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in
                        Christ Jesus.</p>
                    <p>14 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
                    <p>15 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are
                        Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
                    <p>16 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not
                        ashamed of my chain:</p>
                    <p>17 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and
                        found<span>&nbsp;</span><em>me</em>.</p>
                    <p>18 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things
                        he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>

                    <p class="center"></p>
                    <p>THOU therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
                    <p>2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to
                        faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
                    <p>3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs
                        of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>this</em><span>&nbsp;</span>life; that he may please him who hath
                        chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
                    <p>5 And if a man also strive for masteries,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is he
                        not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
                    <p>6 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
                    <p>7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
                    <p>8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my
                        gospel:</p>
                    <p>9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil
                        doer,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>even</em><span>&nbsp;</span>unto bonds; but the word of God is not
                        bound.</p>
                    <p>10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect&rsquo;s sakes, that they may also obtain the
                        salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
                    <p>11<span>&nbsp;</span><em>It</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>a faithful
                        saying: For if we be dead with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, we shall also live
                        with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him:</em></p>
                    <p>12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>if we
                        deny<span>&nbsp;</span><em>him</em>, he also will deny us:</p>
                    <p>13 If we believe not,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>yet</em><span>&nbsp;</span>he abideth faithful: he
                        cannot deny himself.</p>
                    <p>14 Of these things put<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>in remembrance,
                        charging<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>before the Lord that they strive not
                        about words to no profit,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>but</em><span>&nbsp;</span>to the subverting of
                        the hearers.</p>
                    <p>15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
                        dividing the word of truth.</p>
                    <p>16 But shun profane<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>vain babblings: for they
                        will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>
                    <p>17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus;</p>
                    <p>18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and
                        overthrow the faith of some.</p>
                    <p>19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that
                        are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
                    <p>20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of
                        earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>
                    <p>21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and
                        meet for the master&rsquo;s use,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>and</em><span>&nbsp;</span>prepared unto
                        every good work.</p>
                    <p>22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call
                        on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
                    <p>23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
                    <p>24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, apt to teach, patient,</p>
                    <p>25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them
                        repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
                    <p>26 And<span>&nbsp;</span><em>that</em><span>&nbsp;</span>they may recover themselves out of the
                        snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>

                    <p>THIS know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
                    <p>2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
                        disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
                    <p>3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of
                        those that are good,</p>
                    <p>4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
                    <p>5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
                    <p>6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with
                        sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
                    <p>7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                    <p>8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt
                        minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
                    <p>9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto
                        all<span>&nbsp;</span><em>men</em>, as theirs also was.</p>
                    <p>10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity,
                        patience,</p>
                    <p>11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what
                        persecutions I endured: but out of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>them</em><span>&nbsp;</span>all the
                        Lord delivered me.</p>
                    <p>12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
                    <p>13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
                    <p>14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of

                    <p>15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise
                        unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
                    <p>16 All scripture<span>&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span>&nbsp;</span>given by inspiration of God,
